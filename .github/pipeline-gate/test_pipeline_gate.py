"""What the gates would catch, which running them against this repository does not say.

Every check here is a negative case. `pipeline_gate.py filters` and
`pipeline_gate.py images` pass against the checkout, and a gate that has only
ever been observed green is a gate nobody has established is looking at
anything — CLAUDE.md names that as this repository's most-repeated failure, and
the licence gate's suite exists for the same reason one directory over.

Three of the tests below have no defect in them at all. Their subject is the
gate's own parser: an empty pattern list, an empty matrix, an empty stage. Each
one is a state in which every other check passes while reporting a complete
inventory it never read.
