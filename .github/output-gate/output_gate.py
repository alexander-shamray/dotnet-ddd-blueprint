"""Fail the build when it has written into `src/` or `tests/`.

Section 4.1 states it as a property of the tree: `src/` and `tests/` hold
source, and nothing a build wrote. `Directory.Build.props` is what makes that
true, and its `Output` comment is where it is argued — which SDK default the
outcome actually rests on, and why pinning that property here would have been
the worse trade. This gate keeps the outcome true and deliberately carries
none of that reasoning: a second copy is a second thing to reconcile when the
SDK moves, and citing the owner instead is `docs/change-locality.md` section
2's whole point.

What belongs to this file is the shape of the check, and it has three parts.

**It proves a restore and a build both ran before reporting that neither wrote
here.** "No `obj/` under `src/`" is satisfied by a checkout nobody has
touched, which is the single state a pass must not cover — so every project
must also be found under `artifacts/obj/` *and* under `artifacts/bin/`. The
two are one assertion only by accident: a restore alone creates every
`artifacts/obj/<Project>/` and no `artifacts/bin/` at all, measured on this
repository, so `obj` answers *did the restore's output land in `artifacts/`*
and `bin` answers *did anything compile*. Asking only the first would print
that every project was built after a bare `dotnet restore`.

**The subject is checked rather than assumed.** A walk that finds no project
satisfies every assertion above, and a gate that quietly stops looking at the
newest tree is this repository's most-repeated failure. So the projects found
on disk under `src/` and `tests/` are reconciled with the ones
`Platform.slnx` lists, in both directions.

**Reconciled by path, because the artefacts layout keys on the name.**
`UseArtifactsOutput` pivots a project's output on `MSBuildProjectName`, which
is the `.csproj` stem — so two projects whose files share a stem share one
`artifacts/obj/` entry, and a gate keying its two views on the stem as well
would let the listed project stand in for an unlisted one and report a subject
it never looked at. Paths reconcile; a duplicate stem is refused on its own
terms, before anything is looked up by name.
