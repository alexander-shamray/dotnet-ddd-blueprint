"""What the gate is looking at, and what it does when it finds nothing.

The gate's own argument is that a build wrote nothing into `src/`. The failure
that argument cannot survive is a walk that reads no tree: every assertion the
gate makes is satisfied by an empty set, and an empty set is exactly what a
renamed source root, a moved solution file or a typo in `SOURCE_ROOTS`
produces. So most of what follows is about the subject rather than the verdict
— a green result has to be a claim about the projects this repository holds
and not about none of them.

The last class of test reads the real repository instead of a fixture, because
the subject is the one thing a fixture cannot check: a tree this gate does not
walk is invisible to every test that builds its own tree.

        `obj/`, the residue this gate fails on would arrive in a commit first
        and the gate would be reporting a defect a review had already merged.

        Reading the file for the substring `[Oo]bj/` looked like that check
        and was not. The substring survives being commented out, and a later
        negation overrides the rule while leaving it in place — both leave a
        text assertion green with git tracking build output. `git check-ignore`
        answers the question the invariant is about.

        **The source file is the control, and it is what makes the other two
        mean anything.** A `.gitignore` of `*` ignores every path offered to
        it, so a test that only asks about paths it wants ignored passes on
        the one rule that would ignore the whole repository.

        The paths are given as files inside the directories rather than as the
        directories themselves: `--no-index` leaves git unable to tell a bare
        `.../obj` is a directory, so a trailing-slash rule does not match it.
        Measured, and the reason each path below names a file.

        **And the matching rule is asserted, not merely the verdict**, because
        `.gitignore` also carries `[Dd]ebug/` and `[Rr]elease/` — so a path
        under `obj/Debug/` comes back ignored with `[Oo]bj/` commented out,
