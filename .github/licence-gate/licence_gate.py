"""Fail the build on a package pin whose licence has not been cleared.

Appendix B is the register of what is cleared. `Directory.Packages.props` is
what CI will actually restore. Section 4.4 asks for a check that the two agree,
and this is it: a package in the props file and not the register is how a
licence obligation gets acquired by a restore rather than by a decision.

The props file is not the only thing that can add a restore, so every
`.csproj`, `.props` and `.targets` is read as well. A `PackageReference`
carrying its own `Version` or a `VersionOverride`, and a project setting
`ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` to anything but `true`, each resolve a package
no register row was ever asked about. All of them are ordinary MSBuild, and
none of them puts a `PackageVersion` element anywhere the pin reader looks.

It reads every file as text and resolves nothing over the network, which is why
Section 15.1 can put it ahead of the build fork. Nothing here needs a restore,
and the scan that catches a licence obligation is cheapest before anything has
compiled.
