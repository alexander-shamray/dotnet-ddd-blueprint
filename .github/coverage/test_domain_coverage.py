"""The merge's arithmetic, which is the part that can be quietly wrong.

The reporter had no suite until PR-25, and the argument for that is still on
the file: it gates nothing and asserts nothing about the repository. What
changed is that it now merges. Every failure below moves the printed number
without raising, and a coverage figure that is wrong but plausible is worse
than none, because it is the one people read.
