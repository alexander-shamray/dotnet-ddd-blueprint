"""Fetch a deployed realm through Keycloak's admin API and write it out.

The one file in `deploy/keycloak` that talks to anything. It is deliberately
thin and deliberately separate: `realm_check.py` decides, this fetches, and
keeping the network on the other side of a file boundary is what lets the
decision have a suite at all — `deploy/canary`'s split, adopted rather than
re-invented.

**What it writes is a realm export, not a new format.** Keycloak's
`GET /admin/realms/{realm}` answers a `RealmRepresentation` and
`GET /admin/realms/{realm}/clients` answers the `ClientRepresentation` list
that a full export carries under `clients`; joining the two produces the same
document shape `deploy/compose/keycloak/realm-export.json` holds. That is why
one predicate can judge both, and it is the whole reason this file exists in
this form rather than as a second checker.

**It never interprets.** A missing key stays missing and a client this
repository has never heard of is written out unchanged, because the only thing
that may decide whether a realm is compliant is the file that has a suite.

**Credentials fail closed.** Every one of the four environment variables is
required and an absent one stops the run naming it. There is no "check what we
can": a realm-obligation check that quietly degrades to checking nothing is the
fail-open shape §12's gate-coverage rule refuses, and it would report a pass on
the exact realm this gate was filed for.

**Plain HTTP is refused.** The admin API carries a bearer token that can read
every client secret in the realm, and §11.2 already refuses metadata over plain
HTTP outside Development. There is no development affordance here because there
is no local subject: the Compose realm is checked from its file.

Stdlib `urllib`, so `deploy/keycloak` adds no dependency and no
licence-register entry. Two GETs and a form POST is not a client library.

# Keycloak pages client MODELS and filters representations it cannot render
# afterwards, so neither a short page nor an empty one proves there is nothing
# behind it. There is no clients/count endpoint to appeal to, and the export
# that would be authoritative needs rights this credential deliberately does
# not hold.
#
# So completeness is not inferred at all. `max` is asked for far above any
# realm this platform will have, and a response AT the ceiling is refused
# rather than truncated — the one case where the answer might not be the whole
# list is the one case this stops on. `first` is not sent: there is nothing to
# skip when the ceiling is the whole realm.

# THE ROLE THAT MAKES A COMPLETE ANSWER POSSIBLE, and it is checked rather than
# assumed. Keycloak applies `max` to the client-model stream and then drops the
# representations the caller may not see, so a client this account cannot view
# is absent from a response that is otherwise indistinguishable from a complete
# one — a short list proves nothing, and neither does a ceiling.
#
# There is no clients/count endpoint to compare against, and the export that
# would be authoritative needs rights this credential deliberately does not
# hold. What CAN be established is the premise the completeness rests on: with
# view rights over the realm's clients, nothing is filtered. So the token is
# read for the grant that was actually issued, and a run whose account cannot
# see every client stops instead of judging the ones it can.
#
# `view-realm` IS NOT ONE OF THEM, and an earlier revision of this list said it
# was on the reasoning that it implies `view-clients`. It does not, and this
# repository ships the proof: in `deploy/compose/keycloak/realm-export.json`
# the `realm-management` role `view-realm` is `"composite": false` with no
# composites at all, while `view-clients` is a separate role composing
# `query-clients`. Accepting it would have approved a credential with no client
# visibility for a check whose entire purpose is to establish that it has some.
#
# `realm-admin` stays because it composes `view-clients` in that same file. The
# suite asserts both of those facts against the export rather than restating
# them here, so a realm that reorganises its roles fails a test instead of
# quietly widening what this accepts.
