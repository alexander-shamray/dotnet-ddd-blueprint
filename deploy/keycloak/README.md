# The realm gate

**What §11's token obligations are, which realms are held to them, and what
this tree deliberately does not check.**

[ADR-042](../../docs/backend-architecture/adr/ADR-042-the-deployed-realm-is-checked-at-deploy-time.md)
is the decision; [§15.1](../../docs/backend-architecture/15-cicd-deployment.md)
lists this as the fifth `deploy/**` subtree CI exercises rather than deploys.
This file is that tree's operational reference, on
[`deploy/observability/README.md`](../observability/README.md)'s terms.

## The two subjects, at three moments

| | |
|---|---|
| `realm.yml`, `check` | `deploy/compose/keycloak/realm-export.json` — [§14.1](../../docs/backend-architecture/14-local-development.md)'s Compose realm, on every change to it, to `AuthenticationExtensions.cs` or to this tree |
| `deploy.yml` | the realm a deployment is about to be rolled onto — **derived from the chart**, fetched by `read_admin.py`, and judged before the rollout changes anything |
| `realm.yml`, `deployed` | the realm every deployed release points at, **between rollouts** — the same three calls, hourly and on `workflow_dispatch`, over every workload in `deploy/canary/canary.json` ([ADR-043](../../docs/backend-architecture/adr/ADR-043-the-deployed-realm-is-checked-between-rollouts.md)) |

**One predicate judges both subjects**, because a Keycloak realm export and the
admin API's `RealmRepresentation` are the same document — the export is that
representation serialised, and the client list a full export carries under
`clients` is what `GET /admin/realms/{realm}/clients` answers. **And one
derivation names the deployed one at both moments**: the scheduled job derives
the realm out of each release's `identity.authority` exactly as the rollout
does, pins the origin from the same Environment variable, and the suite asserts
the three calls are there, in order, in both files.

```bash
py -3.12 -m unittest discover -s deploy/keycloak
py -3.12 deploy/keycloak/realm_check.py inputs
py -3.12 deploy/keycloak/realm_check.py check --kind local
```

## What it asserts

- `accessTokenLifespan` equals the `AccessTokenLifetime` `Common.Web` declares.
  **Read out of that declaration**, never restated —
  [ADR-040](../../docs/backend-architecture/adr/ADR-040-no-host-accepts-a-token-with-more-life-left-than-the-revocation-bound.md)
  made it the one place the number lives.
- No client carries an `access.token.lifespan` attribute disagreeing with it.
  Keycloak resolves the client attribute over the realm value, so a realm at
  300 with one client at 18000 issues five-hour tokens to that client.
- No client enables the implicit flow, which is what makes
  `accessTokenLifespanForImplicitFlow` unreachable and its silence honest.
- `web-app` carries `use.refresh.tokens` `"false"`
  ([ADR-034](../../docs/backend-architecture/adr/ADR-034-the-browser-holds-an-access-token-and-no-refresh-token.md)),
  and carries it — an absent attribute is the violation, because Keycloak's
  default is to issue refresh tokens on the standard flow.
- `web-app` enables the standard flow, without which the line above holds
  because the client mints nothing at all.
- `directAccessGrantsEnabled` is **off in a deployed realm and on in the local
  one**. That is the one obligation that inverts, which is why `--kind` is
  required and has no default: §11.2 documents the password grant as a local
  affordance a deployed realm turns off, and §14.1's documented login *is* that
  grant.

## What it does not check

- **`ClockSkew`.** It is the other half of ADR-033's 330 and it is not a realm
  setting at all — it is `Common.Web`'s, pinned by `JwtAuthenticationTests`.
  An operator told to configure a realm `ClockSkew` would go looking for
  something that does not exist.
- **Everything else in the realm — and it does not merely decline to check
  it, it does not hold it.** What the gate judges is a projection of six named
  fields, so the audience mapper, the permission vocabulary, the client scopes,
  the two development logins and every client secret are not in the object at
  all. Those belong to `tests/Common.Web.Tests/RealmImportTests.cs`, which is
  not superseded. The projection is also why no message here can leak a
  credential: there is none to leak.
- **A realm with more clients than the ceiling.** The client list is read in
  one request asking for far more than any realm this platform will have, and a
  response *at* that ceiling stops the run rather than being truncated.
- **Whether the answer was filtered — directly.** Keycloak applies `max` to the
  client-model stream and then drops the representations the caller may not
  see, so a filtered list and a complete one look the same and no ceiling or
  page boundary can tell them apart. What is checked instead is the premise:
  `read_admin.py` reads the roles out of its own token and stops before asking
  unless the account holds `view-clients` or `realm-admin`. The
  token is decoded and **not verified**, which is safe because nothing is
  authorised on it — the server issued it and the server enforces the roles;
  it is read to find out whether this account could see the whole realm.
  **`view-realm` is not accepted** and reads as though it should be: Keycloak
  defines it as a non-composite role granting nothing else, so it carries no
  client visibility. The suite asserts that against §14.1's export rather than
  restating it here.
- **A realm edited since the last scheduled run.** Between rollouts the realm
  is read on `realm.yml`'s schedule, so what bounds the window a drift is live
  in is that cadence and ADR-040's runtime guard together — nominally an hour
  of the first, and only as reliably as GitHub runs a schedule, which is best
  effort: a run can be delayed or dropped under load, without a red one. For
  the token lifetime the second gates *remaining* life rather than the issued
  one. A shorter cron is a one-line change; what would make the hour a bound
  is the monitor the next bullet names, and what the job cannot become is
  continuous — the section below says what a red run does.
- **Whether the schedule is still running.** A dropped run and the sixty-day
  suspension are the same silence at two scales: GitHub sheds or delays a
  scheduled run under load, and suspends the `schedule` trigger outright in a
  repository with no commit for sixty days, and neither leaves a red run — a
  stabilised service is exactly the repository with no commits and exactly the
  one the window is longest on. Nothing in this tree can observe its own
  absence; what closes both is a monitor outside GitHub asking whether this
  workflow ran in the last day, and that is an operating decision this file
  names rather than takes.
- **Which realm a *future* rollout will install.** The authority is read from
  the release as it stands, so a rollout that also changes `identity.authority`
  checks the realm it is leaving. Nothing here does that — `-f
  stable-values.yaml` carries the value forward — but a change that started
  moving authorities would owe this file a second look.
- **Anything about a cluster.** Neither deployed moment has ever run, because
  `deploy.yml` has never reached a cluster and says so in its own header, and
  the scheduled job's first command is a `helm get values` that needs the same
  missing login. What has been executed is the local half — which is exactly
  why the local half exists: a deploy-time check nothing has ever run is a
  check nobody has established is looking at anything.

## What a red scheduled run means

`realm.yml`'s `deployed` job files an issue when its judgement goes red, or
comments on the open one — titled *The deployed realm no longer holds section
11's token obligations, or could not be read*, labelled `security` and
`critical`, linking the run. It is an issue and not a runbook because
`docs/runbooks/` is one file per Prometheus alert and its gate fails on a
runbook with no alert behind it; nothing in §13.6 fires this, so the procedure
is here.

1. **Read the run log first, and decide which of the two it was.** The job
   cannot tell a drifted realm from a realm it could not read — an expired
   credential and a raised lifespan are both red — and it labels for the
   worse case on the rollout's rule that a realm nobody can see holds no
   guarantee anybody can state. Each workload is its own log group; the
   `realm-gate:` lines name the field and the client, and a `read_admin.py`
   refusal names what it could not do.
2. **A drift is corrected in the realm, never in the gate.** The obligations
   are the list above and every one of them is a setting ADR-033 or ADR-034
   rests on. Deleting or loosening the check to clear the issue converts a
   realm that was seen to be wrong into one nobody looks at, which is the
   state #157 was filed about.
3. **A credential failure is [`docs/secrets.md`](../../docs/secrets.md)'s
   rotation procedure**, and until it is done the next rollout is refused as
   well — the same credential, the same refusal.
4. **Close the issue on a green `workflow_dispatch` of `realm.yml`**, from
   `main`, and on nothing weaker. A run that goes green because the schedule
   was disabled is the sixty-day silence above, arranged by hand.

**Nothing deploys onto the drift meanwhile.** `deploy.yml` runs the same
judgement before any rollout changes anything, so what the issue tracks is the
window in which the realm is live as it stands — and the token lifetime's half
of that window is already bounded at every host by ADR-040.

**The job is opted in, and the opt-in is not the skip this repository
refuses.** `deploy.yml` runs on `workflow_dispatch` alone because a rollout on
`push` would go red on every merge for want of a cluster; an hourly job would
do that twenty-four times a day. The skip refused elsewhere reads a *runtime*
failure as absence; this guard reads a *configuration*: the repository
variable `REALM_CHECK_SCHEDULED` is set to `enabled` by whoever provisions the
`production` Environment, and until then there is no realm for the job to be
silent about. Once it is set nothing below it is optional. A repository
variable rather than an Environment one, because a job-level `if:` is
evaluated before the job enters its Environment.

## The credential

`read_admin.py` needs four values and stops naming every one that is missing,
and they arrive from two different places on purpose. **Two callers hold
them**: the rollout, once per dispatch, and the scheduled job, once an hour —
the second consumer [`docs/secrets.md`](../../docs/secrets.md) argues as a
second grant, and it is the same account with the same two reads.

**Two are configured.** `KEYCLOAK_CHECK_CLIENT_ID` and
`KEYCLOAK_CHECK_CLIENT_SECRET` come from the `production` GitHub Environment;
[`docs/secrets.md`](../../docs/secrets.md) carries how the service account is
provisioned and rotated, and why it is the one credential here that reaches no
row of §15.4's table.

**Two are derived.** `KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL` (the **server root**, not the realm's
issuer URL) and `KEYCLOAK_REALM` are written into `$GITHUB_ENV` by
`realm_check.py authority` in the rollout, and exported per release inside the
scheduled job's loop, out of the `identity.authority` the release is running
with. A realm named beside the chart rather than out of it is a check that can
pass on a realm nobody is deploying to.

**And one pins where the credential may be sent.** `KEYCLOAK_TRUSTED_ORIGIN` is
a third Environment variable, and it is what keeps the derivation above from
being worse than the hole it closed: `identity.authority` lives in the cluster,
so deriving the *origin* from it would let whoever can edit a release have this
job post its client secret to a host of their choosing. The origin is pinned
here, the realm is derived there, and `authority` refuses a release whose
authority names any other origin.

A base URL that is not `https` is refused: the bearer token that fetch obtains
can read every client secret in the realm. So is a redirect — `urllib` carries
an `Authorization` header onto a redirected request, and the `https` check says
nothing about where a 302 leads.
