"""The fetcher's refusals, which are the only part of it that decides anything.

`deploy/canary/read_prometheus.py` ships without a suite and this file is the
departure from that precedent rather than an oversight. What that module does
before its one GET is build a URL; what this one does is **refuse** — an absent
variable, a plain-HTTP authority, a body that is not the document it asked for.
Each of those is a decision that fails a deploy, so each is a negative case, and
none of them needs a socket.

The GETs themselves are still untested and still untestable here, exactly as
they are one tree over: a fake `urlopen` proves that this file can parse what a
fake wrote.
