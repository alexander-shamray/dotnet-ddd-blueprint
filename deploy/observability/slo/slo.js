// The k6 SLO run of §13.7 and §15.1 — the first real gate after the staging
// deploy.
//
// IT IS NOT A SMOKE TEST, and §15.1 declines to have one for the reason §12.1
// gives: a gate nobody has defined is a gate that gets configured to pass. This
// stage is named for what it asserts. It is also NOT a capacity test — it
// catches the regression where a query loses its index and goes from 40 ms to
// 4 s, which no unit test will find.
//
//   # CLIENT_SECRET comes from the runner's MASKED environment and never from
//   # `-e`: a `-e CLIENT_SECRET=…` puts the real value in k6's process
//   # arguments, and CI logs the command line. k6 exposes system environment
//   # variables through __ENV by default, so inheriting it needs no flag.
//   export CLIENT_SECRET="$SLO_RUN_CLIENT_SECRET"

//
// WHAT THE SLO CLIENT MUST BE GRANTED, because nothing in this repository
// creates it: the token needs `orders:write` (§11.4's permission claim) and a
// `sub` that parses as a GUID — `HttpContextCurrentUser.Id` calls
// `Guid.Parse` on it, and an order's owner is bound from the principal rather
// than from the request. §14.1's Compose realm has no such client; it grants
// `orders:write` to `demo` only. A staging realm has to add one, and that is a
// deployment obligation this file states rather than assumes.
//
// SLO_PRODUCT_ID must have a row in `ordering.ProductPrices` for the run's
// currency, or §6.6's worked case applies and every order is refused with 422.
//
// TWO INSTRUMENTS, DELIBERATELY. k6 measures wall-clock at the client, which
// includes the edge, TLS and the network; §13.7's command and query rows read
// `request.duration`, which is dispatcher entry to result. k6's number is
// therefore strictly LARGER than the thing the SLO is about, so the thresholds
// below are a coarse guard and Prometheus adjudicates in teardown(). Asserting
// only k6's would fail a healthy service on a slow link; asserting only
// Prometheus's would let a broken edge through with perfect handler timings.

// is in front of every request:
//
//   anonymous     (catalog-public)  100 req / minute / IP,      QueueLimit 0
//   authenticated (ordering)        300 tokens / minute / sub,  QueueLimit 10
//
// An earlier draft ran 30/s and 5/s — 1,800/min and 300/min. The first is
// eighteen times the anonymous budget, so everything past the first hundred
// listings in each window is a 429; the second sits exactly ON the
// authenticated ceiling, where arrival jitter turns a slice of the writes into
// 429s and QueueLimit 10 is not a margin on 300.
//
// With `checks: ['rate==1']` that fails the run on a HEALTHY platform, and
// `http_req_failed` does not count 429 — so without the checks threshold the
// durations would look fast and it would pass instead. Both outcomes are the
// trap this file already guards against for 422, arriving through the limiter
// rather than the domain.
//
// **Do not raise these to make the run heavier**, and do not point BASE_URL at
// a service port to escape the limiter: `/api/v1/...` 404s there, and the edge
// is precisely what the client-side thresholds exist to see (§13.7). If more
