"""Gate for deploy/observability and docs/runbooks.

§13.9 requires every alert to have a runbook and every runbook to have an
alert — "checkable in both directions: an alert with no runbook is a 3 a.m.
page with no procedure, and a runbook with no alert is a procedure nobody will
be told to follow." That is checks 1 and 2 below.

§13.6 adds a third leg: "An alert has three parts: a condition, a signal and a
procedure." Two of the alerts in that chapter were written against signals that
did not exist, and both looked correct — the dashboard is empty either way,
whether the system is healthy or the metric was never published. Checks 4 and 5
are that leg, in both directions:

  * every metric a LOADED rule reads is published by something;
  * every metric an AWAITING-SIGNAL rule reads is published by nothing.

The second is what makes awaiting-signal.yaml self-clearing. The day somebody
ships the missing instrument, this gate goes red and names the rule to move —
an "awaiting signal" list that nothing re-checks would quietly become a list of
alerts nobody ever turned on.

Check 6 is the gate's own subject: a parser that silently extracted nothing
would pass 4 and 5 vacuously, which is this repository's most-repeated failure.

Check 8 covers what 4 and 5 structurally cannot. They are about metric NAMES;
the loaded outbox alerts group `by (service_name)`, so a service that runs the
dispatcher and publishes no gauges is "covered" by four alerts that can never
fire for it. Every such service must publish the gauges or carry a stated
exemption, and both directions fail.

Stdlib only, on the licence gate's terms: no restore, no dependencies, and it
runs before anything is built.

# THE CACHE ROW HAS NO PREDICATE HERE, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN A
# SHRUG.
#
# An earlier version of this gate treated `hybrid_cache_hits` / `_misses` as
# published once a host called `AddRedisConnections`, on the reasoning that what
# that alert is owed is a consumer rather than an instrument. Reading the pinned
# package settled it the other way: `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Hybrid`
# 10.0.0 references `System.Diagnostics.Tracing` and **not**
# `System.Diagnostics.Metrics` — it publishes through `HybridCacheEventSource`
# with `PollingCounter`, so there is no `Meter` and no instrument for OTel to
# collect. §13.2's `AddMeter("Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Hybrid")` therefore
# collects nothing today, and would still collect nothing with Redis wired.
#
# So a consumer is necessary and not sufficient, and gating on one would have
# been worse than the gap it replaced: the gate would go red the day a host
# wired Redis, somebody would move the rule into platform-alerts.yaml, and it
# would sit there silent — a loaded alert that cannot fire, which is precisely
# what the two-file split exists to prevent.
#
# What that row is really owed is an instrument: an EventCounters-to-OTel bridge
# in this repository, or a package that publishes a Meter. The first would be a
# `Create*` call and check 5 would see it. **The second is invisible to this
# gate**, and is named in §13.6 and in the README as a residual rather than
# left implicit — a gate cannot watch a dependency's internals.

# Services that host §9.4's dispatcher and publish NO outbox gauges, each with
# the reason. Check 8 requires an entry here for every such service, so the
# absence is a decision somebody argued rather than a dashboard nobody noticed
# was empty.
#
# The four loaded outbox alerts group `by (service_name)` and read gauges only
# Ordering publishes. A stalled Catalog outbox is therefore the silent case
# §13.6 spends its callout on — and Catalog is §4.5's template, so every
# scaffolded service inherits the gap until this is closed.

# finds the counters, and silently misses every gauge §13.6 added. It did, on
# the first run of this gate, and the symptom was four correct alerts reported
# as having no signal.
#
# The KIND is captured too, because a metric's exported series depend on it: a
# histogram exports `_bucket`/`_count`/`_sum`, a counter `_total`, a gauge the
# bare name. Matching on a stripped prefix instead — which this did until
# Copilot's sixth round — accepts `outbox_pending_count_total` for a gauge that
# exports no `_total` series at all, so check 4 could certify an alert that
# queries a name nothing writes. The whole point of check 4 is that it cannot.
