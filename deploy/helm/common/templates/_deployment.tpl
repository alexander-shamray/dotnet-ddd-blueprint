        A config-only deploy changes a ConfigMap and nothing else, so without
        this the pods keep serving the values they started with and the deploy
        reports success (§15.1). Hashing into the pod template is what turns a
        values change into a rollout.

        THE WHOLE OF `.Values`, not the rendered ConfigMap, and the narrower
        version is how this was found. Hashing `commerce.configmap` covers the
        ConfigMap this template mounts and misses every other one: the gateway
        renders `gateway-edge` from its own template (§15.3), so a change to
        `cors.origins` or `ingress.trustedNetworks` rewrote a mounted ConfigMap
        while the pod annotation stayed byte-identical — a silent no-op deploy
        on the two keys most likely to be edited without a rebuild.

        The cost is over-triggering, and it is the safe direction: a change to
        `autoscaling.maxReplicas` or `ingress.host` touches nothing in the
        container and rolls the pods anyway. That is one rollout nobody needed.
        The alternative was a deploy that reported success and changed nothing.
