{{- /*
§7.4's migration Job, run by Helm as a hook before anything else in the release
moves. ADR-007 is the decision behind it: never `Database.Migrate()` at
application startup, because three replicas race to apply the same migration, a
rolling deploy runs old code against a new schema, and the runtime identity
would need DDL permissions it must not have.

The hook weight is negative so this runs ahead of any other hook a chart grows,
and `before-hook-creation` deletes the previous Job of the same name rather
than leaving a graveyard of completed ones. Both are §7.4's.

**Idempotent, not merely correct once** (§15.1). A config-only deploy goes
through the same `helm upgrade` and therefore the same hook with the same
migrator image, and `Database.Migrate()` applies nothing when the history table
is already current — which is what makes re-running it on every deploy safe.

Rendered only where `image.migrator` is set — and the gateway and the BFF do
not include this template at all, because they own no database (§10.1, §4.2).
Two ways of saying one thing, deliberately: §15.3 argues the gateway's chart is
not a service chart with the database parts deleted, so the absence is
structural, and the guard here is what catches a chart that grows the template
before it grows the value. smoke.sh asserts the two agree, because either half
on its own is a claim nothing tests.

REQUIRED, not `if`. A chart that includes this template is a chart that owns a
database, and `image.migrator` was acting as an opt-out: clearing it made the
Job vanish and let the release roll application pods against an unmigrated
schema — silently, because a template that renders nothing renders no error.

The gateway and the BFF do not reach this line at all; they carry no
`migrate-job.yaml`. That is the structural half, and this is the other: the
only charts that get here are the ones that must run a migration, so the image
is a requirement rather than a switch. `smoke.sh` asserts the two halves agree.

  VALIDATED, not truncated, and the truncation was a defect of its own.
  Kubernetes stamps `job-name` onto the pods this Job creates and a label value

  "-"` looked like the guard and cut in the middle of the tag: 42 `a`s followed
  by `.b` truncates immediately after the dot, `trimSuffix "-"` does not touch a
  trailing `.`, and the API server rejects the hook — after `helm upgrade` has
  started.

  A truncated name is also a name that can collide, which is the quieter half:
  two tags sharing a 63-character prefix would produce one Job.

  So the derived name is checked whole and a tag that does not fit is refused.
  The budget is comfortable for what CI supplies — `ordering-api-migrate-` is 21
  characters and a 40-character commit SHA lands on 61 — and a tag that
  overruns it is a deploy that must fail rather than one that mangles a name.

    and nothing ever collects the last one. A namespace would carry one
    completed migration Job per release it has ever seen. That is not
    theoretical tidiness: the runbook (§13.6) looks for the failed Job, and it
    is looking in a list of every migration that has ever succeeded.

    Failures are deliberately NOT collected. `hook-failed` would delete the one
    artefact `migration-failure.md` needs, so a failed migration stays until
    somebody has read it — which is also why there is no
