The name every object a chart renders takes — and the one thing here that is
deliberately NOT derived from the release name.

Helm's convention is `{{ .Release.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Name }}`, and it is wrong
for this platform: these names are ROUTING CONFIGURATION. The gateway's route
file resolves `http://catalog-api:8080/` and `http://ordering-api:8080/`
(§10.2, appsettings.json), and the BFF's one synchronous hop resolves
`http://catalog-api:8081` from a literal in PricingHop.cs, which argues on the
record that the value does not vary because "the host is the Kubernetes Service
name". A release-derived name makes that false the moment the umbrella chart
installs the same workload under a different release, and the failure is a 502
rather than a template error.

So the name is a value, and it is required. `workload.name` is what the Service

with `IsNullOrWhiteSpace` and says in its own comment that an environment
variable set to the empty string arrives as `""` rather than null. So an
overlay with `identity.authority: " "` rendered cleanly, began a rollout, and
died in the new pod — which is the failure every render-time guard here exists
to move earlier.

**The canary is a SECOND RELEASE of the same chart**, differing in

nothing else — no `helm rollback`, and no image change on the pods serving the
rest (ADR-022).

**The schema is not part of that, and this comment used to say it was.** The
canary release runs §7.4's migration hook — it is the first thing carrying the
new image — so a rollback removes the pods and leaves the schema migrated.
ADR-022 says so in its own consequences; what makes it survivable is §15.5's
requirement that every migration be backward compatible with the previous
release, which the cheap rollback does not buy and does not excuse.

Traffic splits because BOTH tracks answer to the SAME Service: the selector
above carries the workload name and nothing about the track, so kube-proxy
spreads connections across every pod behind it and the share the new version
serves is `canary / (stable + canary)`. That is also why the weight is

The same match put it inside the PodDisruptionBudget, so a one-shot pod counted

`-migrate` on the name is what breaks both, and `component` says what the pod

callers, in Catalog and Ordering. So the two keys are rendered below, under

connection strings eagerly, so a host that caches nothing still fails at
startup without them — and §8.5's idempotency store reads the *coordination*
instance, which is not a cache at all and is the `noeviction` half of §8.1's
split. Keying the requirement on caching would leave the one key this PR
