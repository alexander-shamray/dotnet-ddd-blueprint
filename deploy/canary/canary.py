"""The canary's arithmetic and its verdict, and a gate over the plan itself.

§15.5 specifies the rollout: "route 5% of traffic to the new version, watch
error rate and p99 for ten minutes, then progress to 25%, 50%, 100%. Roll back
automatically if either metric regresses beyond threshold." This file is the
half of that sentence a workflow cannot be trusted with -- the weight
arithmetic and the promote/rollback decision -- kept out of YAML so it can be
asserted.

**It reaches no cluster and no Prometheus.** `plan` and `analyse` are pure
functions over their arguments; the workflow queries Prometheus and runs
`kubectl scale`, and hands the numbers here. That split is what makes a canary
nobody has run still worth shipping: the part that decides is testable today,
and the part that acts is four commands whose failure is loud.

Stdlib only, on the licence gate's terms -- no restore, no SDK, no
dependencies. The plan is JSON rather than YAML for the same reason
`deploy/observability/dashboards` is: there is no stdlib YAML parser, and a
gate that needs a `pip install` is a gate that gets skipped.

    -- so the share the new version serves is `canary / (stable + canary)` and
    the achievable weights are the fractions that arithmetic can make. With
    §15.3's `replicaCount: 3`, the smallest canary is one pod and the smallest
    weight is 25%, which is five times the 5% §15.5 asks for.

    **The requested weight is a ceiling, not a target to land on.** The canary

    that is safe to be wrong in: undershooting means a smaller blast radius
    than was asked for, and overshooting means more traffic on the new version
    than anybody authorised. A step labelled 5% that serves 25% is the failure
    this whole function exists to prevent, and rounding to the nearest
    expressible weight is how it would have happened.

    One pod is the floor, so where even a single canary exceeds the ceiling
    there is nothing to round down to and this raises. The message names the
    stable replica count that WOULD satisfy the request, because that is the
    decision the operator actually has -- scale up and pay for it, or accept a
    coarser step and say so in `tolerance`.

    This rule and `required_stable` are one design read from two ends: that

    about the k6 SLO run -- it "fails on an absent series as well as on a
