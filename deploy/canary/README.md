# Canary rollout

§15.5's progressive delivery, as data and one decision function.
[ADR-022](../../docs/backend-architecture/adr/ADR-022-the-canary-is-a-second-release-weighted-by-replicas.md)
records the mechanism.

**Nothing here has ever reached a cluster.** There is no dev, staging or
production environment for this repository, no kubeconfig and no registry.
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is `workflow_dispatch` only for that reason — a
canary on `push` would fail on every merge for want of a cluster, and a
pipeline that is red by design trains everybody to ignore it. This is the third
artefact of that kind: PR-23 shipped charts nothing installs and PR-24 alert
rules no Prometheus loads.

What is asserted, and by what, is the whole of the next two sections.

## What runs

```bash
py -3.12 -m unittest discover -s deploy/canary   # the arithmetic and the verdict
py -3.12 deploy/canary/canary.py check           # the plan against this repository
```

Stdlib Python, no dependencies, no SDK, no `helm`, no Docker — the licence
gate's terms, which is why the gate can run before anything is built.
`deploy/helm/smoke.sh` covers the other half: it renders the canary track of
every chart and asserts what comes out.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `canary.json` | §15.5's ladder, the thresholds, the PromQL and the workload map |
| `canary.py` | The weight arithmetic, the promote/rollback verdict, and the gate over `canary.json` |
| `read_prometheus.py` | The one file that talks to anything. Runs the queries and writes what came back |
| `test_canary.py` | The suite. It is the whole of the assurance the rollout has |

## What it asserts

`canary.py check` is seven checks and the last two are about itself:

1. The ladder climbs, ends at 100%, and every rung but the last has a dwell.
2. Every threshold `analyse` reads is present — it indexes them, so a missing
   key would be a `KeyError` with a canary already serving traffic.
3. The absolute thresholds **are** §13.6's alert thresholds, read out of
   `platform-alerts.yaml` rather than restated. A canary tuned looser than the
   alert promotes a release and then pages about it.
4. Each workload's `serviceName` is an entry assembly this solution builds, and
   its `chart` is a chart under `deploy/helm`.
5. Every metric the queries read is one a loaded alert reads — which
   `deploy/observability/check.py` has already established is published by
   something. Not a second copy of that scan; a composition with it.
6. The parser found host assemblies at all, so checks 4 and 5 cannot pass
   vacuously.
7. Both of `deploy.yml`'s triggers cover every path in `SOURCE_INPUTS`.

## What it does not

- **It reaches no cluster and no Prometheus.** Every function in `canary.py` is
  pure over its arguments; the workflow fetches and acts.
- **It does not validate PromQL.** The queries are strings here. A syntax error
  in one surfaces as a failed query at the end of a ten-minute dwell — which
  the verdict reads as an absent series and therefore as a rollback, so it
  fails safe and slowly rather than unsafely.
- **It does not hold the weight against a voluntary disruption.** The
  PodDisruptionBudget belongs to the stable release and its selector matches
  both tracks, so it constrains the total rather than the stable count: a node
  drain during a dwell can evict stable pods and leave the canary serving more
  than the rung asked for. The verdict is still measured rather than assumed —
  `analyse` reads both tracks' real numbers — so the cost is exposure for one
  dwell, not a wrong decision. ADR-022 records why the temporary stable-track
  budget that would fix it is deferred.
- **It does not establish that a replica ratio is a traffic ratio.** kube-proxy
  spreads *connections*, not requests. Keep-alive, HTTP/2 multiplexing to the
  gRPC listener, or a client that opens one connection and holds it will all
  under-deliver the weight, and nothing short of a cluster can measure that.
  ADR-022 names it as owed.
- **It cannot see an ad-hoc `--set` at deploy time**, the same reach
  `deploy/helm/README.md` states for the chart gate.
- **It does not establish that `deployment_track` is a label on the deployed
  backend's series.** `deployment.track` is a *resource* attribute, and the
  standard OTLP-to-Prometheus mapping puts only `service.name`,
  `service.namespace` and `service.instance.id` on each series — the rest go to
  `target_info`. §14.1's collector copies this one attribute onto the datapoint
  with a `transform` processor, and **the deployed collector must do the
  same**. Without it every query matches nothing, which this reads as an absent
  series and rolls back: every rung, on a healthy canary. The requirement is in
  ADR-022; nothing here can check it, because the cluster's collector is not in
  this repository.

## The two things worth knowing before reading the code

**The requested weight is a ceiling, not a target.** `plan` returns the largest
canary that stays *within* it and refuses where even one pod overshoots, naming
the stable replica count that would satisfy the step. A replica ratio is
quantised, so §15.5's 5% needs 19 stable replicas; at the chart's default of 3,
one canary pod is already 25%. The refusal is the deliverable — rounding to the
nearest expressible weight is how a step labelled 5% comes to serve five times
the blast radius anybody authorised.

**There is no third verdict.** Promote or roll back, and every doubt resolves to
the second: an absent series, a canary too quiet to judge, a breach, or a
regression against the stable track. That is affordable because of what the
mechanism is — the canary is a second Deployment and the stable release is
never touched, so a rollback costs the canary's own pods and nothing else. When
rolling back is cheap, "inconclusive" is not caution, it is a canary left
serving traffic on nobody's authority.
