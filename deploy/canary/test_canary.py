"""The canary's arithmetic and its verdict, which are the only parts testable.

Nothing in this repository has ever run a canary — there is no cluster, and
`deploy/canary/README.md` says so in its first paragraph. What that makes this
suite is the whole of the gate: the workflow is four commands whose failure is
loud, and every decision it takes comes from here.

The verdict tests are weighted toward the ways an analysis can pass when it
should not. A canary that rolls back wrongly costs a deploy; one that promotes
wrongly ships the release it was meant to catch, and every path to that runs
through a reading nobody took.
