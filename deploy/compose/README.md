# Local development environment

[§14.1](../../docs/backend-architecture/14-local-development.md) is the
specification for this directory; this file records what a developer needs
at the keyboard. One command starts the infrastructure:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait
```

| Service | Host port(s) | Credentials |
|---|---|---|
| SQL Server | 1433 | `sa` / `Local_Dev_Pa55w0rd!` — override with `SQL_PASSWORD` |
| Redis (cache) | 6379 | — |
| Redis (coordination) | 6380 | — |
| RabbitMQ | 5672, management http://localhost:15672 | guest/guest |
| Keycloak | http://localhost:8080 | admin/admin |
| OTel collector | 4317 (OTLP gRPC), 4318 (OTLP HTTP) | — |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 | — |

The credentials are development defaults, documented deliberately (§14.1);
every deployed environment takes its secrets from a vault
([§15.4](../../docs/backend-architecture/15-cicd-deployment.md)). Copy
`.env.example` to `.env` to override one.

## Application services

Application services join this file as their images land —
[Appendix C](../../docs/backend-architecture/appendix-c-delivery-plan.md)
sequences them. Catalog is the first: `catalog-migrator` applies the schema
and exits, then `catalog-api` starts (§14.1's pair rule).

| Service | Host port(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Catalog API | http://localhost:5102 | `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/openapi/v1.json` (needs a token — see below), `/v1/catalog/products` |
| Gateway | http://localhost:5000 | `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, and [§10.2](../../docs/backend-architecture/10-api-gateway.md)'s four routes |
| Ordering API | http://localhost:5101 | `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/openapi/v1.json` (needs a token — see below), `/v1/orders` — every route needs a token, unlike Catalog's listing |
| Web BFF | http://localhost:5200 | `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/v1/checkout/quote?productId=…&currency=GBP` — a token needed, and the only host that mints one of its own ([§11.5](../../docs/backend-architecture/11-identity-authorization.md)) |

**Both OpenAPI documents need a token**, and that is a decision rather than an
oversight. `MapOpenApi()` carries no authorization metadata, so the
deny-by-default fallback
([ADR-030](../../docs/backend-architecture/appendix-a-adrs.md#adr-030--authorization-is-deny-by-default-in-the-building-block))
answers 401 to an anonymous request for one: the document enumerates every
route and every schema its service has, and
[§11.2](../../docs/backend-architecture/11-identity-authorization.md) assumes
the network is hostile. The path still exists and still generates — fetch it
with the token *Getting a token* below shows how to obtain:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:5102/openapi/v1.json
```

The health probes stay anonymous, because the kubelet carries no token
([§13.5](../../docs/backend-architecture/13-observability.md)).

The gateway is the single entry point for external clients
([§10.1](../../docs/backend-architecture/10-api-gateway.md)), so the same
listing is reachable two ways — and the two are not equivalent:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5102/v1/catalog/products     # the service, directly
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/catalog/products # through the gateway
```

The edge adds `/api`, which the gateway strips before forwarding, and applies
what the service does not: the rate limit, the CORS policy, and a correlation
ID on every request that arrives without one — and on every request carrying
one the edge will not adopt (§10.4). **One of the four routes has no
service behind it yet** — `/api/v1/inventory` answers 502 until Inventory
lands — and it is in the file deliberately, because the two configuration
tests over it are what PR-17 exists to deliver. `/api/v1/orders` was one of
three until PR-18 and `/bff` until PR-19, which is what "stops answering
502" looks like: the route file did not change, because PR-17 shipped it whole
and a service PR that re-decides a route is the mistake §10.2's dual-version
trap describes. `/api/v1/catalog` is GET-only at the edge, so publishing a
product is a call to port 5102 and not to port 5000.

## Getting a token

PR-16 closed the gap this file used to name: publishing a product now needs a
bearer token carrying `catalog:write`. **Listing products does not, and that is
permanent** — [§10.2](../../docs/backend-architecture/10-api-gateway.md)'s
`catalog-public` route is GET-only and names `anonymous`, YARP's reserved value
for `AllowAnonymous`, so a product listing is public at the edge and public
here. It used to name no policy at all and mean the same thing; ADR-030's
fallback is what ended that, because a route saying nothing now inherits the
fallback and answers 401. The route says what it means instead — which is the
same reason the OpenAPI documents above changed and this one did not.

The realm ships two logins, both development defaults in the sense §14.1
already uses for `admin/admin` and `guest/guest`:

| User | Password | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `demo` | `demo` | `catalog:write`, `orders:write`, `orders:cancel` |
| `browser` | `browser` | nothing — the account that proves a refusal |

`orders:admin` is grantable and held by **nobody**, deliberately: it overrides
§11.4's ownership check, and the 404 that hides another customer's order stays
demonstrable only while no shipped login can bypass it.

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s http://localhost:8080/realms/commerce/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    -d grant_type=password -d client_id=web-app \
    -d username=demo -d password=demo |
    python -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["access_token"])')

curl -X POST http://localhost:5102/v1/catalog/products \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name":"Walnut desk","amount":19.99,"currency":"EUR"}'
```

The same call as `browser` is a 403 and the same call with no header is a 401.
Both are worth running once: they are the difference between a token being
*checked* and a token being *carried*.

Ordering takes the same token, and **every** one of its routes needs one —
there is no anonymous half, because an order belongs to somebody where a
product listing does not:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5101/v1/orders \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"items":[{"productId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001","quantity":1}],
         "shippingAddress":{"line1":"1 Test Street","city":"Almaty","postalCode":"050000","country":"KZ"},
         "currency":"EUR"}'
```

**No cancel call here, deliberately, because there is no id to cancel with.**
The obvious next line — capture the response and interpolate it into
`/v1/orders/$ORDER/cancel` — is wrong twice over: this call answers with a
problem document, and a call that succeeds answers `Results.Ok(guid)`, whose
body is a JSON *string* with the quotes still on it, which `{id:guid}` cannot
bind. A reader who wants the id then needs `| jq -r .`, and a README that says
so before it can produce one is documenting a shell trick rather than the
service.

**This call answers 422 `order.products_unavailable`, and it will keep doing
so.** That is not a gap waiting on a pull request: prices come from a local
projection of Catalog's events (§6.4), and `00000000-…-0001` is an id no
Catalog event names. The projection that fills `ordering.ProductPrices` has
existed since PR-20 — a product it has never heard of has no row, no price and
no order, which is §6.6's standing consequence rather than a broken example.
Making this `curl` succeed means publishing a Catalog product and ordering
*that* id, which is two more steps than a README block earns; the reachable
proofs here stay the 401, the 403 as `browser`, and the 404 an order you do not
own returns.

Override connection strings with `CATALOG_CONNECTION` /
`CATALOG_MIGRATOR_CONNECTION` and `ORDERING_CONNECTION` /
`ORDERING_MIGRATOR_CONNECTION` — one pair per service, all four commented out
in `.env.example` so the nested `${SQL_PASSWORD:-…}` keeps following an
overridden password rather than freezing it. They default to the `sa` login
above, and only the configuration *keys* differ locally
([§7.1](../../docs/backend-architecture/07-persistence.md),
[§14.2](../../docs/backend-architecture/14-local-development.md)).

To run the infrastructure alone — services on the host, under a debugger —
apply the override (§14.1):

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.infra-only.yml up -d --wait
```

The host process reads none of the `environment:` blocks above, so the three
keys a service refuses to start without have to reach it another way — the
runtime connection string, the bus, and the authority `AddJwtAuthentication`
reads eagerly (§11.3). Same values, host names in place of service names:

```bash
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
export ConnectionStrings__Catalog='Server=localhost;Database=Catalog;User Id=sa;Password=Local_Dev_Pa55w0rd!;TrustServerCertificate=True'
export ConnectionStrings__RabbitMq='amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672'
export Identity__Authority='http://localhost:8080/realms/commerce'
# Catalog is the ONE service that pins its own ports, and on the host they
# have to move. Its appsettings.json declares two Kestrel endpoints — 8080 for
# REST and 8081 for §9.7's gRPC hop, because a cleartext port cannot serve
# HTTP/1.1 and h2c at once — and 8080 on the host belongs to Keycloak, so a
# host run without these two lines fails to bind.
#
# They are the only way to move them: declaring Kestrel:Endpoints at all
# suppresses ASPNETCORE_URLS and ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS entirely, measured
# against both. What still works is the same configuration key from a higher
# provider, which is what these are.
export Kestrel__Endpoints__Rest__Url='http://localhost:5102'
export Kestrel__Endpoints__Grpc__Url='http://localhost:8081'
dotnet run --project src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.Api
```

The failure without them is loud — *Failed to bind to address
http://0.0.0.0:8080: address already in use* — which is the right shape for a
clash between two things that both want a port. It is named here anyway,
because the address it names is Keycloak's and the project it names is
Catalog's, and nothing in that message says the two are related.

Ordering is the same shape with its own key — `ConnectionStrings__Ordering`,
never Catalog's, because `AddOrderingInfrastructure` reads its own name and
`AddSqlServer` throws without it:

```bash
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
export ConnectionStrings__Ordering='Server=localhost;Database=Ordering;User Id=sa;Password=Local_Dev_Pa55w0rd!;TrustServerCertificate=True'
export ConnectionStrings__RabbitMq='amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672'
export Identity__Authority='http://localhost:8080/realms/commerce'
dotnet run --project src/Services/Ordering/Ordering.Api
```

`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` is the first line for a reason: no project here ships
a `launchSettings.json`, so `dotnet run` is Production unless something says
otherwise, and `RequireHttpsMetadata` is on in Production (§11.3). The
authority above is plain HTTP, so the host refuses to fetch the discovery
document at all and every bearer request fails before validation begins. The
container sets the same variable, which is why the Compose path never shows
this.

The override excludes the `gateway` too, and running that one on the host takes
a fourth variable: §10.2's destinations are container names, which resolve on
the Compose network and nowhere else, so a host-run gateway has to be told
where the service actually is.

```bash
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
export Identity__Authority='http://localhost:8080/realms/commerce'
export ReverseProxy__Clusters__catalog__Destinations__d1__Address='http://localhost:5102/'
export ReverseProxy__Clusters__ordering__Destinations__d1__Address='http://localhost:5101/'
export ReverseProxy__Clusters__web-bff__Destinations__d1__Address='http://localhost:5200/'
dotnet run --project src/Gateway/Gateway.Api
```

**A destination joins this block with the PR that builds its service**, the
same rule the Compose file's `depends_on` follows. Ordering's line arrived with
PR-18 and the BFF's with PR-19; without one a host-run gateway 502s the exact
path the PR exists to stop answering 502.

The BFF is excluded too, and it is the one host that needs more than an
authority — §15.4 marks `Identity__Client__*` BFF-only, `ValidateOnStart`
refuses to boot without all three, and its own hop needs Catalog's **gRPC**
port rather than its REST one:

```bash
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
export Identity__Authority='http://localhost:8080/realms/commerce'
export Identity__Client__ClientId='web-bff'
export Identity__Client__ClientSecret='local-dev-secret'
export Identity__Client__Scope='commerce-api'
dotnet run --project src/BFF/Web.Bff
```

**That block leaves the hop pointed at `catalog-api:8081`, which resolves on
the Compose network and nowhere else**, so a host-run BFF answers 503 on
`/v1/checkout/quote` until Catalog is reachable under that name. The address is
a literal rather than a configuration key on purpose (§9.7): it is the same
string in Compose and in Kubernetes, and §15.4's rule is that a value which
does not vary is not configuration. A `hosts` entry mapping `catalog-api` to
`127.0.0.1` is the honest local workaround — and note that a host-run
`Catalog.Api` does listen on 8081, because its `appsettings.json` declares both
endpoints and that file overrides `ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS`.

`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` leads this block for the same reason it leads the one
above, and the block is written to stand alone rather than as a delta on that
shell: without it the authority on the next line is plain HTTP outside
Development, `AddJwtAuthentication` refuses it at startup, and the gateway does
not run at all. Every host here validates tokens (§11.2), so every host-run
block that names an authority needs this line — and the migrator below does
not, because its job never sees a token. **That is the rule and deliberately
not a count**: this sentence said "both of them" until Ordering's block made
three, which is the same way the compose smoke's image count went stale, one
file over.

`Cors__Enabled` and `Ingress__Enabled` are both absent above and both default
to off, which is the shape the flags are written for — off is a valid
topology, on-but-unconfigured is not, and the host refuses to start in the
second state rather than starting into it.

The override excludes `catalog-migrator` as well as `catalog-api`, so the
schema is nobody's job until it is run — on the host, under the *other*
connection string, because §7.1 keeps the two identities apart even where the
local login is one:

```bash
export ConnectionStrings__CatalogMigrator='Server=localhost;Database=Catalog;User Id=sa;Password=Local_Dev_Pa55w0rd!;TrustServerCertificate=True'
dotnet run --project src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.Migrator
```
