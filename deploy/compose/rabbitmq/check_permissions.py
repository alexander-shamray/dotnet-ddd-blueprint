"""Gate for the broker's per-service permissions (#44).

`definitions.json` is JSON, so it can hold no argument and no reference to the
code it has to keep up with. That code moves: a receive endpoint added in a
service's `Messaging.DependencyInjection`, a peer queue added to its
`Endpoints`, a sixth bounded context added to `Common.Contracts` — each changes
what a service must be allowed to touch, and none of them is anywhere near this
file.

**A too-narrow permission does not fail the way a typo fails.** The broker
refuses the operation and MassTransit retries the topology, so the service
stays healthy and silent while a message goes nowhere — the failure mode
`Dockerfile` already records for the delayed exchange, arriving through
authorisation instead of through a missing plugin. That is why this is a gate
and not a comment.

Two halves, and the second is the one #44 is actually about:

  * every resource a service's own code needs, that service may use; and
  * every resource that is somebody else's, it may NOT write.

**Both halves are derived per service, from the code, and nothing here is a
list of service names.** §4.5's scaffold renames the template inside whatever
it renders and adds a broker account for it, so a hard-coded pair would have
been right for exactly as long as this platform had two services and would then
have gone quiet rather than red. That is the same reason §4.2's cross-service
architecture gate is keyed on a predicate rather than a name.

Stdlib only, on the licence gate's terms: no restore, no dependencies, no
broker. It reads text.
