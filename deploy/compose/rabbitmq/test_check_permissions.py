"""The broker permission gate's own suite.

**Every case here is a mutation, and that is the point.** A gate observed only
green is one nobody has established is looking at anything — this repository's
most-repeated failure — and this one guards an authorisation boundary
(ADR-036), so the cases that matter are the ones where it must go RED.

The mutations are the ones that were run by hand while building it, plus the
one Copilot found on PR #160 that none of them covered. Pinning them is the
difference between a negative somebody performed once and a negative the build
performs.

**It mutates a parsed copy of the real `definitions.json` rather than a
fixture.** A hand-written double is a second specification, and a gate tested
against one agrees with itself: the file this asserts on is the file that
ships, so a permission genuinely removed from the real broker fails here too.
