Review uncommitted or branch work for **contradictions and self-consistency
issues**, and manage `suggestions.md` at the repository root.

## Mode selection (do this first)

**Before choosing a mode, check whether `suggestions.md` exists at the repo
root.** That file is the running record of open issues; when it is present,
the default job is to re-verify it, not to ignore it and start a fresh review.

| Condition | Mode |
|---|---|
| `suggestions.md` **exists** and `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or `recheck` | **Recheck** (below) |
| `suggestions.md` **missing** and `$ARGUMENTS` is empty | **Full review** — branch vs `main` |
| `$ARGUMENTS` is `full` or `full --local` | **Full review**, even if `suggestions.md` exists (replace the file from scratch after the new pass) |
| `$ARGUMENTS` is `--local` only, no `suggestions.md` | **Full review** of the working tree |
| `$ARGUMENTS` is `--local` and `suggestions.md` exists | **Recheck** first (same as default when the file exists); do not silently switch to a full local sweep unless the user also passed `full` |
| `$ARGUMENTS` is `recheck` and `suggestions.md` **missing** | Stop: say there is nothing to recheck and offer a full review — do not enter recheck mode against a file that is not there |

`recheck` as an explicit argument is kept for clarity; it is **not** required
when the file is already there. Prefer the file’s presence over the empty
argument list.

## What counts as a finding

Same bar as `/validate-blueprint`: **two statements that cannot both be true**,
or a statement that cannot be true of the system described — not pure style
taste. Prefer:

1. **Blueprint ↔ code drift** once `src/` exists (samples, pins, type names,
   registration order, endpoints, credentials).
2. **Cross-chapter / CLAUDE.md contradictions** (phase markers, test counts,
   planned vs present trees, counts of classes/packages).
3. **Register drift** — `Directory.Packages.props` vs Appendix B vs §4.4 sample;
   licence gate failing.
4. **Deploy drift** — Compose / Helm / CI vs §14 / §15 claims (ports, secrets,
   service names, healthchecks).
5. **Incomplete reconciliation** — a rule this change states (or a fix it claims)
   that the corpus still violates in the same change set.

Reject as non-findings the house styles `CLAUDE.md` tabulates on purpose
(braceless single statements, file-scoped namespaces, explicit types, British
prose beside real identifier spellings, unpinned Aspire with §4.4 carve-outs,
spread-over-`.ToArray()` when the corpus is already clean).

---

## Recheck mode

**Trigger:** `suggestions.md` is present (default), or `$ARGUMENTS` contains
`recheck`.

1. **Read `suggestions.md` in full.** Enumerate every numbered issue from the
   status table and from the per-issue headings. If the file is empty or has no
   numbered issues, say so and offer a full review rather than inventing items.
2. **For each issue, independently:**
   - Locate the sites named under **Where** / **File** (grep siblings if the
     line numbers moved).
   - Verify whether the stated **Problem** still holds in the current tree
     (and, for branch work, against the current tip — not an old diff alone).
   - Set status to exactly one of:
     - **fixed** — evidence shows the defect is gone
     - **open** — still true
     - **correct** — owner accepted the current state as intentional (only if
       the file already said so, or the user has said so in this conversation)
     - **false positive** — original finding was wrong; only if re-verification
       shows the claim never held / no longer applies as a defect
3. **Do not invent new issues** in recheck mode unless verifying a listed item
   surfaces a **direct regression of that item** (same claim, still broken in a
   new place). A full sweep for new findings is `full`, not recheck.
4. **Rewrite `suggestions.md`:**
   - Update the status table and every per-issue **Status** line.
   - Keep fixed items briefly under their headings (or a “Fixed this pass”
     section) so the next recheck still has context — unless step 5 deletes the
     file.
   - Bump **Re-checked:** to today’s date.
5. **If every issue is `fixed`, `correct`, or `false positive`:**
   - **Delete** `suggestions.md`.
   - Report in chat: all closed, file removed, one-line evidence per former
     issue.
6. **If any issue remains `open`:** keep the file, report counts
   (open / fixed / other).

---

## Full review mode

**Trigger:** no `suggestions.md`, or user passed `full` / `full --local`.

1. **Establish the range.**
   - Branch (default): `MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)` (fall
     back to `main`), then `git diff --stat` / `--name-only` / full diff
     `"$MERGE_BASE..HEAD"`, plus `git log --oneline "$MERGE_BASE..HEAD"`.
   - `--local`: `git status --short` and `git diff HEAD` (include untracked
     that matter; skip bulk tooling noise).
2. **Read the change.** Prefer full source of load-bearing files over the
   diff alone. Grep the rest of `docs/backend-architecture/`, `CLAUDE.md`,
   and `src/` / `tests/` / `deploy/` for every claim the change touches.
3. **Run cheap gates when the range touches them.**
   - Packages / Appendix B: `python .github/licence-gate/licence_gate.py`
   - Tests / counts CLAUDE asserts:
     `bash .claude/scripts/dotnet-test.sh [all|fast]` when useful

   **In the sandbox the second one is not available**, and that is deliberate
   rather than an oversight: `dotnet test` has needed a Docker daemon since
   PR-08's Testcontainers suite, so running it inside a container built to take
   capability away would mean Docker-in-Docker. The licence gate is stdlib
   Python and does run there. So a test-count claim is the **host's** to verify
   — report it as unverified rather than asserting it, and never report
   `command not found` as a finding about the branch.
4. **Author findings only when verified.** Quote the conflicting sites.
   Severity: **bug** | **suggestion** | **nit**.
5. **Write `suggestions.md` at the repo root** when any issue is open. Shape:

   ```markdown
   # Suggestions — branch vs `main`   # or "local uncommitted"

   **Reviewed:** <ISO date>
   **Branch:** <name>
   **Base:** origin/main @ <short sha>
   **Scope:** <one line>
   **Diff:** <N files, +/- lines>

   ## Overall
   <2–4 sentences>

   | # | Severity | Item | Status |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | **1** | bug | … | open |

   ## Bugs / Suggestions / Nits
   ### 1. …

   | | |
   |---|---|
   | **Where** | … |
   | **Status** | open |

   **Problem.** …
   **Suggestion.** …

   ## What looks good (no action)
   …

   ## Recommended fix order
   …
   ```

6. **If the review finds nothing open**, do **not** create `suggestions.md`.
   If `full` was requested and an old file existed, **delete** it when the new
   pass is clean; **replace** it when the new pass has findings.
7. **`suggestions.md` is working state.** Never commit it. Do not add it to
   the index. Say so if the user is about to ship.

## Report (chat)

Always end with:

- Mode actually run: **recheck** or **full** (and branch/base or local)
- Whether `suggestions.md` was present at start
- Issue counts by status (open / fixed / correct / false positive)
- Path to `suggestions.md` if kept, or that it was deleted / not created
- One-line top remaining findings (if any)

Do not fix the findings in this command unless the user explicitly asks to
apply them after the review.

**That is enforced now, and used to be prose alone (#60).** This command
declared "do not fix" while holding `Write` and `Edit` over every path
`.claude/settings.json` did not deny — a read-only claim resting on prose while
the grant permits writing everywhere, which for a review command is the worse
failure. The frontmatter's `disallowed-tools` path-scopes `Edit` away from
every tracked tree, `docs/` included, **and from every tracked file at the
repository root**.

**The root files were the hole in the first version of this**, raised in review
and worth stating rather than quietly patching: denying directories alone left
`CLAUDE.md`, `global.json`, `Directory.Build.props` and `Platform.slnx`
writable, which is a boundary with a gap exactly where this repository keeps
its build inputs. A command promising not to fix findings could still apply one
to root configuration.

They are **enumerated** rather than denied wholesale, and `suggestions.md` is
why: it lives at the root, it is this command's one legitimate output, and it
is untracked — so denying every *tracked* root file leaves it alone, where a
blanket `Edit(**)` or a `/*` root pattern would take the deliverable with it.
`test_grok_helpers.py` reads the tracked set from `git ls-files` and asserts
each is denied, so a new root file is a red build rather than a silent gap.

**Two limits, both stated rather than glossed.**

`disallowed-tools` binds the Claude Code host path — `/review-branch` run here,
including `--local`. It says nothing about the containerised run: inside
`grok-review.sh` this file is read by **grok**, a different CLI, under
`--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, and nothing has established that grok
honours a `disallowed-tools` key at all. There the only thing keeping the
reviewer from rewriting the branch it is reviewing is the container's
disposability — a property of the sandbox, not of this grant. Do not read the
frontmatter as reaching that run.

And the list is a deny-list, so a tree added later is editable until someone
adds it. `test_grok_helpers.py` asserts the list covers every tracked
top-level tree, which is what makes that a red build instead of a quiet
widening.

**That test can never see the case that mattered, and the reason is
structural.** It reads `git ls-files`, so it enumerates what EXISTS; the
dangerous file is one that does not. MSBuild imports `Directory.Build.targets`
into every build of every project beneath it, and this command was granted
`Write` and `dotnet build` at once — so creating a root file the enumeration
could not contain, and then running the build the command already had, was host
code execution. Measured: an `Exec` in an auto-imported `.targets` runs, and
`dotnet build` reports success. Raised in review against the list as shipped.

Two changes close it, and they close different halves. The executor is now
`dotnet-test.sh`, which fixes the solution and the flags — `dotnet build` was a
grant this command never used, and `dotnet test:*` admitted both an arbitrary
project path and `/p:CustomBeforeMicrosoftCommonTargets=<file>`, which imports
whatever it is pointed at, `suggestions.md` included. And the auto-import
surface itself is denied: every name MSBuild reads without being asked, in the
exact spelling this file already uses, plus `**/*.targets`, `**/*.props`,
`**/*.rsp`, `**/*.csproj`, `**/*.sln` and `**/*.slnx` for the class.

**Which half is measured is worth saying.** The exact-filename form is the one
this file has always used and the one the suite reads. The `**/` globs are the
documented gitignore-style syntax and are **not** measured here — they are
belt to the exact names' braces, so if that syntax turned out inert in a
`disallowed-tools` value the demonstrated vector would still be closed. Do not
read them as the control; read the names as the control.
