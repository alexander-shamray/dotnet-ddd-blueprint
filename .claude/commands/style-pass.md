A corrected code form has been given:

$ARGUMENTS

It is an instance of a rule, not a one-off fix. Four things follow, and a pass
that does fewer than four is not done.

## 1. Name the rule

State it in one sentence before touching anything, and say what it implies for
cases the example does not show. `builder.Services` / `.AddReverseProxy()` /
`.LoadFromConfig(…)` is not "indent that chain four" — it is *a broken
fluent chain puts every call on its own line at head + 4, the first call
included*, which then decides what happens to a chain whose head is a wrapped
initialiser line.

If the rule as stated would contradict something `docs/style-guide.md` or
`CLAUDE.md` already says, stop and say which. That is a decision about the
whole corpus and it is the user's.

## 2. Sweep the corpus

The named site is one of many. Find the rest across every fenced block in
`docs/backend-architecture/` — and, once `src/` exists, the source too,
because one dialect governs both.

Grep gets you candidates; reading them gets you the shape. Anything structural
— bracket depth, chain heads, continuation columns, raw-string boundaries —
has to track whether it is inside a ```csharp fence, a ```sql fence, a C# raw
string literal, or prose, because the rules differ per context, and that
tracking is done by reading the file rather than by a script this command can
run unattended.

**This command holds no interpreter grant, and the absence is deliberate.** It
used to carry `Bash(python:*)`, which is a prefix grant on a general-purpose
interpreter: `python -c "<anything>"` was auto-approved, and one `open(…,'w')`
reaches every path the `Edit(…)` denies cover — `.claude/scripts/**`,
`.claude/sandbox/**`, `.claude/commands/**`, `.claude/agents/**`,
`.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.remember/**` —
while one `subprocess.run` reaches every `git push --force` and `git switch -fC`
the deny list and the `git-*.sh` helpers exist to keep out. A rule that
matches `python -c` cannot see what the interpreter then does, so the whole
control structure this repository documents sat downstream of one line of
frontmatter. That matters here more than in most commands because the input is
attacker-influenced twice over: `$ARGUMENTS` is a pasted code form, and the
sweep reads `docs/**` and `src/**`, which a PR author controls.

A throwaway script is still the right tool for a genuinely structural sweep.
Write it into the scratchpad and run it — under the default permission mode the
run prompts, and one approval per pass is the whole cost.

**The prompt is not the boundary, and this paragraph should not be read as
claiming it is.** Dropping the grant removes *command-level auto-approval*;
what an unlisted tool then does is the active permission mode's decision, and
under a bypassing mode it runs silently — the same premise `CLAUDE.md` states
for the sweeps' denies. So what this change buys is that the interpreter is no
longer pre-approved by this command, not that a human sees every run. A command
that needed the stronger property would have to refuse those modes, and none
here does.

**Confirm each hit by reading it.** The recurring false positives are real and
they repeat: `})` closing a lambda mid-chain is a continuation, not a chain
head; `(await conn.QueryAsync<T>(` opens two brackets on one line legitimately;
an expression-bodied member is not a lambda; commas inside a generic argument
list are not list elements.

## 3. Record it in `docs/style-guide.md`

The rule goes in that file's C# style or SQL style section, in the
established voice: the rule, an example, and **the reason it is not
arbitrary**. State the exceptions with them — half that file's value is the
carve-outs, and a rule recorded without its exceptions gets applied to the
exceptions next time.

**`CLAUDE.md` keeps a short list of these rules under *Style*, and the guide
is the master copy.** If the form you corrected is one of the ones it names,
the change has to reach both in this pass — a rule in two places that moves
in one of them is the drift the split was accepted in order to buy.

Update any count the change invalidates. `docs/style-guide.md` cites site
counts as evidence and a stale one is a defect (it has said 42 braceless
bodies when there were 53).

## 4. Reconcile `.editorconfig`

**Every time. Without being asked.** It is the file PR-01 ships, not a
documentation convenience.

Three outcomes, and the third is as important as the others:

- **A setting expresses the rule** — set it, with a comment saying what it
  costs and which sites depend on it.
- **A setting would fight the rule** — `dotnet format`'s defaults would undo
  several of these. Pin the setting that keeps a format run idempotent.
- **No setting expresses it** — Roslyn has no wrapping engine, so most of
  these rules cannot be enforced at all. Add it to the "no setting expresses
  these" list in the file, so a reviewer does not go hunting for a key that
  does not exist. Never invent a key.

SQL is the extreme case: it lives inside C# raw string literals, which no
formatter reads. There is deliberately no `[*.sql]` section and there will be
no `.sql` files (§7.4).

## 5. Verify

Re-scan for the invariants the corpus holds. Every one of these has caught a
real regression introduced by a previous pass:

- no line over 120 columns inside a code fence
- no leading `&&`, `||`, `??` or `=>` on a continuation line
- every continuation indent a multiple of four
- no ragged list — one line, or one element per line
- fences balanced, CRLF intact, no trailing whitespace

## Report

The rule as stated, sites changed per file, the `docs/style-guide.md`,
`CLAUDE.md` and `.editorconfig` edits, and the invariant scan results as
numbers. Flag every judgement call where two of the rules both applied and
one had to win — do not bury it.
