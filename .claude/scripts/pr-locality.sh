# Judge a pull request's changed paths against the `| Class |` and
# `| Touch set |` rows its body declares, and print a verdict per path — and
# nothing the author wrote. Read-only, fixed field set.
#
# **Exists so that /review-branch, /review-copilot and /ship can read the two
# rows `docs/change-locality.md` asks a PR body to carry without holding
# `Bash(gh pr view:*)`** — the grant that reaches `--json reviews`, the
# unfiltered feed #56 closed. `body` is the one field this reads from the
# pull request, `filename` the one field it reads from the files endpoint;
# what applies is the shape rule every helper in this directory follows — a
# caller that chooses fields can choose `reviews`, so this one chooses none.
#
# **The output never contains the touch-set cell.** A pull request author is
# not a trusted party, /review-copilot takes any PR number, and a row was the
# one place an author's text reached an Edit-capable agent unfiltered. A path
# grammar cannot close that — `Ignore_all_previous_instructions.md` is a path
# — so the cell is consumed here and only a verdict leaves: one `class` line
# whose value is letters this script validated, then one `inside <path>` or
# `outside <path>` line per changed file, where the path is the diff's own
# and the word is this script's. A caller acts on `outside` lines and never
# sees what the set said. **A changed path is the author's text too** — the
# author names the files, and git permits a newline inside a name — so each
# arrives JSON-encoded, one per line and unambiguous, and is printed only if
# it decodes to a plain path: no escape in it, path characters only, a `/`
# or a `.` in it, no `..` segment. Any other name refuses the whole run,
# because a verdict list with one line withheld is a list a caller would
# read as complete.
#
# Nothing is printed when the body carries neither row; a caller that reads
# nothing skips its touch-set check and says so, and does not infer a class.
# One row without the other is refused, because each command reads the pair.
# A row that fails its grammar is refused with exit 3 naming the row and not
# its content: a class cell is one letter A–E or two distinct letters joined
# by `+`; a touch-set cell is a comma-separated list of path tokens, bare or
# in balanced backticks, of path and glob characters — `*`, `**`, `?` and a
# brace alternation — each carrying a `/` or a `.`, and each
# repository-relative: no leading `/`, no `./`, no `..` segment, brace
# alternatives included, since the edit-target guard judges where an edit
# inside the checkout lands and not a path naming the outside.
#
# **The verdict narrows and grants nothing.** What holds authority is the
# caller's own deny list and the class's tree set in the contract; an
# `outside` line is a finding for the caller, and an `inside` line is not a
# licence for anything the caller's grant refuses.
