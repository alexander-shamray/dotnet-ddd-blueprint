# Appendix B — Dependency licence register

Between 2024 and 2026 several long-standing free .NET libraries moved to
commercial licences. The register below is the state at the time of writing;
**verify before adopting**, because this is exactly the category of fact that
goes stale.

**The backticked names in the Package column are read by a machine.** They are
NuGet package identities, and the licence gate PR-01 ships
(`.github/licence-gate/`) matches them against `Directory.Packages.props` — a
pin with no identity here fails the build before anything compiles
([§15.1](15-cicd-deployment.md)). The props file, not the transcription of it in
[§4.4](04-solution-structure.md): the gate checks that the two agree, but it is
the file CI restores that decides what a licence obligation is.

So a product named in prose and a package named in backticks are different
claims: prose says what the thing is, backticks say what `restore` will resolve.
Adding a dependency means adding its identity here, not just its name.

## Chosen — free for commercial use

| Package | Licence | Role |
|---|---|---|
| ASP.NET Core, EF Core (`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`), YARP (`Yarp.ReverseProxy`), HybridCache (`Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Hybrid`) | MIT | Framework. ASP.NET Core is the one name in this row with no identity beside it, because it is a framework reference rather than a package and has nothing to pin |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` | MIT | The container and logging contracts `Common.Application` compiles against ([§6.2](06-cqrs.md), [§13.3](13-observability.md)), and since PR-14 the logging one is `Common.Infrastructure`'s too — `OutboxDispatcher`'s `LoggerMessage.Define` delegates, which ADR-019's CA1848 requires on a loop running twice a second ([§9.4](09-messaging.md)). Both ride in ASP.NET Core's shared framework, which is why the row above needs no identity for them — but neither building block takes a framework reference ([§4.2](04-solution-structure.md)), so each pays for them as packages |
| `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` | MIT | The half of EF Core that `dotnet ef migrations add` runs in ([§7.4](07-persistence.md)). A separate identity from the framework row above rather than a name on it, because it is referenced with `PrivateAssets="all"` by each `*.Migrator` and ships in no image — a row that says "framework" would imply otherwise |
| `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` | MIT | A transitive of the row above, pinned explicitly because the floor it declares resolves to a version carrying eight advisories and NU1903 fails the restore. Design-time only — it ships in no image — and registered anyway, on the rule that a pinned transitive is still a pin |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions` | MIT | `IConfiguration`, named in each `AddXInfrastructure` signature (§4.2). Registered on the abstractions row's terms: it rides in the shared framework, and `*.Infrastructure` is not a web project, so it pays for the contract as a package |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` | MIT | The generic host each `*.Migrator` builds (§7.4). The one project shape in this blueprint that is neither a web host nor a library, so it is the one that pays for hosting as a package |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions` | MIT | `IHostEnvironment`, the single source of `RedisKeys`' key prefix ([§8.3](08-caching-redis.md)). Rides in the shared framework and in the `Hosting` meta-package above, but `Common.Infrastructure` takes neither, so it pays for the contract as a package — the abstractions rows' terms again |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Options` | MIT | `AddOptions<RedisCacheOptions>().Configure` — §8.2's `InstanceName` and connection reuse are options configuration, called directly by `Common.Infrastructure`, so the assembly is referenced directly |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis` | MIT | HybridCache's L2 ([§8.2](08-caching-redis.md)): `AddStackExchangeRedisCache` and `RedisCacheOptions`. The `IDistributedCache` implementation over `StackExchange.Redis` — a separate identity from both its neighbours, because it is the package that actually stores an entry in Redis and neither of them is |
| `Dapper` | Apache 2.0 | Read-side data access ([§6.5](06-cqrs.md)), the raw writes `IUnitOfWork.ExecuteRawAsync` makes on the command's own transaction (§6.3), the outbox dispatcher's claim, complete and fail statements in `Common.Infrastructure` ([§9.4](09-messaging.md)), and the retention purge's two `DELETE`s beside them since PR-15 ([§9.5](09-messaging.md)) — the last two being neither read nor command, running on a connection of their own outside any transaction. All four named, because a register row saying "read-side" reads as an audit of where the package may appear, and a use this row does not list would then look unregistered |
| `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` | MIT | `SqlConnection`, constructed by each service's `SqlConnectionFactory` behind §6.5's `IDbConnectionFactory`. EF's SqlServer provider carries it transitively at the same version; the explicit pin exists because `*.Infrastructure` names the type directly, and referencing what is actually used keeps this register honest |
| MassTransit **8.x** (`MassTransit`, `MassTransit.RabbitMQ`, `MassTransit.EntityFrameworkCore`) | Apache 2.0 | Messaging. Three identities on the health-check row's terms: the transport package is what each `*.Infrastructure` references, and the core package is referenced directly three times — by the harness smoke ([§12.5](12-test-strategy.md)), because the in-memory harness is core API and a test project that uses no transport must not claim one; by `Common.Infrastructure` since PR-14, for the `IPublishEndpoint` the outbox dispatcher publishes the Broker lane through ([§9.4](09-messaging.md)); and by `Common.Infrastructure.Tests` since PR-15, which drives §9.4's two consumers over the same harness for the same reason the smoke does. The second of those is the first common code to name a MassTransit type. All three are named here on the `Dapper` row's standard: a role that reads as an audit of where a package may appear has to list every place it does — and the licence gate cannot enforce it, because the *identity* was already registered and only the role went stale. The persistence integration is PR-21's and is referenced once, by `Ordering.Infrastructure`, for §9.6's `EntityFrameworkRepository` — the only saga in the solution, so the only project that may claim it |
| `StackExchange.Redis` | MIT | Redis client |
| `FluentValidation` | Apache 2.0 | Input validation |
| `FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtensions` | Apache 2.0 | `AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining` — the registration line in each `AddXApplication` ([§4.2](04-solution-structure.md)). A separate identity from the row above because it is a separate package: the scan does not ship in `FluentValidation` itself, and a register matching on prefixes is the drift the health-check row below names |
| `Scrutor` | MIT | Assembly scanning for handler registration ([§6.2](06-cqrs.md)) |
| OpenTelemetry .NET (`OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting`, `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol`, `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore`, `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http`, `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime`, `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.EntityFrameworkCore`, `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.StackExchangeRedis`) | Apache 2.0 | Telemetry, including logging ([§13.2](13-observability.md)) — there is no separate logging library. All seven written out rather than abbreviated to a prefix, for the reason the health-check row below gives |
| Polly (`Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience`) | MIT | Resilience |
| `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` | MIT | §11.3's token validation, registered by `Common.Web` for every host because every service re-validates ([§11.2](11-identity-authorization.md)). Registered here on the abstractions rows' terms inverted: this one does **not** ride in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`, which carries the authentication abstractions and the cookie handler and has not carried a JWT handler since ASP.NET Core 3.0 — so the one building block that does take a framework reference still pays for this as a package |
| `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` | MIT | The OpenAPI document each service host serves ([Appendix C](appendix-c-delivery-plan.md), PR-07) — the framework's own generator, document only, no UI |
| `Microsoft.OpenApi` | MIT | The generator's document model — a transitive dependency pinned explicitly, because the floor the package above declares resolves to a version with a known vulnerability and NU1903 fails the restore. A pinned transitive is still a pin, so it is registered like any other |
| `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.SqlServer`, `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Redis` (Xabaril) | Apache 2.0 | The readiness checks §13.5 registers. Written out in full rather than abbreviated to `.Redis`, so a text comparison against the pins in `Directory.Packages.props` matches on the whole name — an abbreviation here is satisfied by `StackExchange.Redis` and the check passes while the row is missing. The one third-party runtime dependency that is easy to leave off this table, because "health checks" sound like framework and are not. **No `.Rabbitmq` sibling, deliberately** (PR-13): the broker's readiness check is the one MassTransit itself registers, and the Xabaril check would need an `IConnection` nothing registers — §13.5 carries the argument |
| gRPC for .NET (`Grpc.AspNetCore`, `Grpc.Net.ClientFactory`, `Grpc.Tools`, `Google.Protobuf`) | Apache 2.0 / BSD-3 | The BFF's synchronous hop and its `.proto` contract ([§9.7](09-messaging.md)) |
| `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` | MIT | `WebApplicationFactory` for the API-contract tests ([§12.4](12-test-strategy.md)) |
| `Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost` | MIT | `TestServer` for the host building blocks, which have no entry point for `WebApplicationFactory` to find ([§10.4](10-api-gateway.md)) |
| xUnit v3 (`xunit.v3`, `xunit.runner.visualstudio`, `xunit.v3.extensibility.core`) | Apache 2.0 | Test framework, and the VSTest adapter through which `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` discovers its tests. Three identities rather than one: the adapter is a separate package and omitting it is silent — the build succeeds, `dotnet test` reports no tests and exits zero ([§12.1](12-test-strategy.md)) — and the third is the fixture contract alone, `IAsyncLifetime` and `TestContext`, for `*.TestSupport` libraries, which `xunit.v3` itself refuses to build ([§12.4](12-test-strategy.md)) |
| `NSubstitute` | BSD-3 | Mocking |
| `Shouldly` *or* `AwesomeAssertions` | BSD-3 / Apache 2.0 | Assertions. An either/or row: only the chosen library is pinned in §4.4, and the licence gate excludes the other rather than reporting it as a dropped pin |
| Testcontainers for .NET (`Testcontainers.MsSql`, `Testcontainers.Redis`, `Testcontainers.RabbitMq`, `Testcontainers.Keycloak`) | MIT | Integration test infrastructure. The Keycloak module is [§11.5](11-identity-authorization.md)'s suite, and the only place the solution runs an identity provider |
| `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt` | MIT | `JwtSecurityTokenHandler`, which [§11.5](11-identity-authorization.md)'s suite reads the `aud` claim with. A transitive of the JWT bearer handler, pinned because a project names the type |
| `SSH.NET` | MIT | The SSH transport behind Testcontainers' port forwarding — a transitive dependency pinned explicitly, on the same terms as `Microsoft.OpenApi` above: the floor the row above declares resolves to a version carrying GHSA-q939-rpr3-3284 and NU1903 fails the restore. Registered because a pinned transitive is still a pin, not because anything here opens an SSH connection |
| `Respawn` | MIT | Test database reset |
| `WireMock.Net` | Apache 2.0 | HTTP stubbing |
| `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` | MIT | The test host every test project needs; pinned because a major bump changes discovery |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing` | MIT | `FakeTimeProvider` — the clock seam §12.7 requires |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` | MIT | `ServiceCollection` for the registration and behaviour-ordering tests of [§6.2](06-cqrs.md) and [§6.3](06-cqrs.md). A separate identity from the abstractions row above, and not a redundant one: that package is contracts, with no container in it to build |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` | MIT | `ConfigurationBuilder` and `AddInMemoryCollection` for `AddRedisConnections`' tests ([§8.2](08-caching-redis.md)), which build a real configuration rather than substitute the contract — the container row's argument, one abstraction over |
| `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.InMemory` | Apache 2.0 | Reads log records, metrics and spans back out of a real pipeline for the observability tests — §13.4's redaction tests, which that chapter prints one of, the meter-coverage tests guarding §13.2's meter list in `Common.Web.Tests`, and the Redis client-span tests in `Common.Infrastructure.Tests` proving `AddRedisConnections` instruments its own connections ([§13.2](13-observability.md)). A separate row from the runtime OpenTelemetry entry above rather than an eighth name on it: that row's role is the telemetry every host exports, and this package is referenced by no project under `src/` |
| `NetArchTest.Rules` | MIT | The architecture gates ([§4.2](04-solution-structure.md)) that PR-07 makes a build failure rather than a review comment ([Appendix C](appendix-c-delivery-plan.md)) |
| `Aspire.Hosting.*` (`AppHost`, `SqlServer`, `Redis`, `RabbitMQ`, `Keycloak`) | MIT | Topology for the optional AppHost of [§14.2](14-local-development.md). Registered ahead of use: Compose is the baseline (§14.1) and Aspire is not adopted. **If** it is, `src/AppHost` is the only project taking these, which is what keeps it deletable. **Not pinned in [§4.4](04-solution-structure.md)** — see the carve-out there; adopting Aspire means adding the pins in the same change |
| `Aspire.*` client integrations (one per resource a service consumes) | MIT | The service-side half of §14.2. Registered ahead of use: **if** Aspire is adopted each service takes the integrations for its own resources, which is why backing it out costs a line per resource per service rather than deleting one project. Unpinned on the same terms as the row above |
| Keycloak | Apache 2.0 | Identity provider |
| RabbitMQ | MPL 2.0 | Message broker |
| OpenTelemetry Collector (contrib) | Apache 2.0 | Local and CI telemetry pipeline — the `otel-collector` container of [§14.1](14-local-development.md) |

## Avoided — commercial, with the replacement used here

| Package | Change | Replacement in this blueprint |
|---|---|---|
| **MediatR** v13+ | Commercial from 2025 | Hand-rolled dispatcher (§6.2) |
| **AutoMapper** v15+ | Commercial from 2025 | Explicit mapping, by hand (§9.3). A source generator such as Mapperly is the alternative, and is not pinned here because nothing in the blueprint uses one |
| **MassTransit** v9 | Commercial from 2026, $400–1,200/month | Pinned to v8 (Apache 2.0) |
| **FluentAssertions** v8+ | Per-developer-per-year from 2025 | Shouldly, or AwesomeAssertions (a fork of v7) |

## Requires a licence review

| Component | Condition |
|---|---|
| SQL Server | Per-core or CAL licensing; Developer Edition is free for non-production only |
| Duende IdentityServer | Free below a revenue threshold; commercial above it |
| Redis | Redis 7.4+ is under RSALv2/SSPLv1. Valkey (BSD) is a drop-in fork if the terms are a problem |
| Grafana OTel-LGTM (`grafana/otel-lgtm` image) | AGPL 3.0 for Grafana, Loki, Tempo and Mimir (the Prometheus-compatible store inside the image). Development and CI only ([§14.1](14-local-development.md)); never deployed, so no distribution or network-service obligation arises |

PR-01 ships the CI step that enforces the first table. `.github/licence-gate/`
fails the build on three things, and the third is the one worth naming because
it runs the other way:

- a pin in `Directory.Packages.props` absent from this register;
- a registered licence outside its allow-list;
- a **registered identity that is pinned nowhere** — a dropped pin, or a row
  that outlived its dependency. The carve-outs of [§4.4](04-solution-structure.md)
  are encoded as exceptions to this one: the Aspire rows are deliberately
  unpinned, and an either/or row expects only its chosen half to appear.

Discovering a licence obligation at renewal time is considerably more expensive
than discovering it at build time.

**The table above is beyond its reach, and deliberately so.** SQL Server,
Duende, Redis and the Grafana OTel-LGTM image are products rather than
packages — nothing restores them, so nothing reading `Directory.Packages.props`
can see them, and the client libraries that talk to them sit in the first table
under their own licences. That boundary is a review obligation and there is no
tooling behind it.
