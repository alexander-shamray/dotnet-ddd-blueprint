# Backend Architecture Blueprint

**A reference architecture for ASP.NET Core microservices using DDD, CQRS and TDD.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Reference blueprint — adapt, don't copy wholesale. The C# solution it specifies will be built in this repository ([Appendix C](appendix-c-delivery-plan.md)) |
| **Target runtime** | .NET 10 (LTS), C# 14 |
| **Last reviewed** | 2026-08-02 |
| **Availability figures** | Illustrative. The arithmetic of compounding is the point; the inputs are round numbers, not measurements |
| **Sample domain** | E-commerce (illustrative only) |
| **Revision** | Revised across successive design reviews. Load-bearing corrections: transaction failure and rollback semantics, outbox type and payload stability, single message identity, business counters as claims rather than calls, public URL shape. Originally merged with a parallel design, which contributed the delivery plan, composition-root gate, Redis eviction isolation, dual DB identities, cursor pagination and hop budget |
