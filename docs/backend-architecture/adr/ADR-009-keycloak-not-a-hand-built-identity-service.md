# ADR-009 — Keycloak, not a hand-built identity service

**Decision.** Keycloak (Apache 2.0) as the OIDC provider.
**Why.** Authentication is a solved problem with a long tail of security detail
and no business differentiation. Building it creates liability and no value.
**Consequences.** Keycloak is another component to run, upgrade and back up.
Realm configuration must be source-controlled and imported, not clicked through
the admin UI.
