# ADR-017 — One synchronous hop

**Decision.** At most one synchronous downstream service call per inbound
request. Synchronous calls inside message consumers require a written exception.
**Why.** Availability multiplies and latency accumulates down a chain. Four
services at 99.9% give 99.6% — 43 minutes of monthly downtime becomes nearly
three hours with no service having missed its own target.
**Consequences.** Cross-context data must arrive by event and be projected
locally, which means designing for staleness in the UI. That is the intended
trade.
