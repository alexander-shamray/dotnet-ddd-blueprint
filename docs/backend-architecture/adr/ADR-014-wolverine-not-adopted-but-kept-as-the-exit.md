# ADR-014 — Wolverine not adopted, but kept as the exit

**Decision.** MassTransit for messaging, a hand-rolled dispatcher for in-process
CQRS.
**Why.** Wolverine is a credible single-stack alternative covering both, with a
strong transactional inbox/outbox story. It is not adopted because it couples
the CQRS choice to the messaging choice — replacing one would mean replacing
both.
**Consequences.** Wolverine remains the most likely destination if MassTransit
v8 maintenance ends and v9's licence is declined (ADR-003). Confining every
MassTransit type to Infrastructure — behind `IIntegrationEventPublisher` on the
publish side and thin consumer adapters on the receive side — is what keeps that
migration a bounded piece of work rather than a rewrite. Switching is an
ADR-level decision, not a silent swap.
