# ADR-011 — Compose baseline, Aspire optional

**Decision.** Docker Compose is the documented local development environment.
Aspire is offered as an optional accelerator.
**Why.** Compose is universal, stable and language-agnostic, which suits a
reference architecture. Aspire gives a materially better inner loop and free
distributed tracing, but adds a fast-moving dependency and a visible tooling
opinion.
**Consequences.** Two local-dev paths to document and keep working. Mitigated by
Aspire's ability to emit a Compose file from the same model, and by the low exit
cost (section 14.2).
