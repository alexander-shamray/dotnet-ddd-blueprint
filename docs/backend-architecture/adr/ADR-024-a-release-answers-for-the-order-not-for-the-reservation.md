# ADR-024 — A release answers for the order, not for the reservation

**Decision.** `ReleaseStock` is idempotent over **ordering** as well as over
repetition, and Inventory owes two guarantees for it:

1. **It always publishes `StockReleased`.** The event reports the command's
   postcondition — no stock is held for this order — and not a state change, so
   a release that finds nothing to release publishes exactly as one that frees a
   reservation does.
2. **A release for an order whose `ReserveStock` has not arrived is
   remembered**, and the `ReserveStock` that follows it is refused rather than
   creating a reservation nobody is waiting for. **The refusal answers with
   `StockReleased`**, because that is what it establishes — no stock is held
   for this order — which is the same postcondition guarantee 1 reports and
   needs no new member in the vocabulary.

Both are stated in [§3.2](../03-bounded-contexts.md) beside Inventory's row. They
are commitments on a service that does not exist yet, which is the cheapest
moment to take them.

**Why.** [§9.4](../09-messaging.md) orders nothing between two deliveries, and
[§9.6](../09-messaging.md)'s saga sends `ReleaseStock` from every compensating
transition it has, without ever knowing whether the `ReserveStock` it undoes has
been handled. **The count is deliberately not given**: it read "four" here for
as long as the machine had five, because three *states* send a release and four
absorb an early one, and a third figure between them is exactly the kind nothing
recomputes.
Nothing in the sender can establish that, so the guarantee has to be the
receiver's.

**A conditional acknowledgement pages a human on the ordinary case.**
`Compensating`'s **stock half** settles exactly two ways: `StockReleased`, and
a ten-minute `ReleaseTimeout` that raises a `stock_not_released` review. Under
the other reading — a release of nothing has nothing to report — every no-op
release leaves through the timeout.

`StockReservationFailed` reaches `Compensating` having *proved* the reservation
was never taken, so that is not a corner case but a routine one, and the review
row it raises names a stranded reservation that never existed. A contract whose
normal path escalates to on-call is the wrong contract.

**The second guarantee is the only thing that closes the stranding.** With the
first alone, a release handled before its reserve is a no-op that publishes,
the saga finalises on it, and the `StockReserved` that follows correlates to no
instance and is discarded — a reservation held for an order that is cancelled,
with nothing raised anywhere
([#125](https://github.com/alexander-shamray/dotnet-ddd-blueprint/issues/125)).
The saga cannot close that from its side: by the time the late `StockReserved`
exists the instance is gone, so any transition written for it is a transition
nothing can reach. The tombstone moves the reconciliation to the only place
that still has both facts.

**Consequences.**

**Inventory carries a tombstone, and it is not free.** A release for an unknown
order is a row that must persist long enough to meet the `ReserveStock` it is
waiting for, and be reaped afterwards. That is the same retention question
[§9.5](../09-messaging.md)'s inbox already answers for itself, and Inventory's PR
inherits it rather than inventing it.

> mid-ladder.**

**The saga may absorb a `StockReleased` that overtakes its own cancellation.**
Inventory consumes `OrderCancelled` directly ([§3.2](../03-bounded-contexts.md)),
so one publication starts two races to the saga's queue. Absorbing the early
arrival used to lose it — the saga would then wait out a release it had already
discarded — and under the first guarantee it does not, because the saga's own
`ReleaseStock` is answered whatever Inventory did with the event. `Ignore` is
sound *because of this ADR* and not on its own, which is stated at each of the
three sites that send one.

> **Whether the event should reach Inventory at all is
> [ADR-029](ADR-029-inventory-releases-on-the-cancellation-not-on-the-sagas-word.md)'s

> because the early arrival is the only evidence a cancellation gives the saga.
> So the absorptions this ADR names, here and under *Nothing enforces it*
> below, have since stopped being an `Ignore`: each records the arrival on the
> instance, and forward transitions are guarded on what it recorded (§9.6).

**A `stock_not_released` review now means what it says.** It is raised only when
a release genuinely never completed, so
[`order-review.md`](../../runbooks/order-review.md)'s procedure no longer has to
open with "check whether there was ever a reservation".

**Nothing enforces it until Inventory is built.** No gate can hold an unwritten
service to a contract, and this repository's own rule is that a list of things
known to be missing needs something asserting they are still missing. What
stands in for it here is that every place the machine leans on it says so at
the line: `AwaitingStock`, `AwaitingPayment` and `AwaitingConfirmation`'s
`When(StockReleased)`, the cancellation branches those three states absorb
for, and `Compensating`'s `Ignore(StockReserved)` and
`Ignore(StockReservationFailed)`. So an Inventory built to a different rule
contradicts a paragraph rather than failing silently. **The sites are named
rather than counted** for the reason the Why section declines a count — a
figure over a set the next branch can add to is one nothing recomputes.
