# ADR-004 — No mediator library

**Decision.** Implement the command/query dispatcher and pipeline in
`Common.Application` — roughly 80 lines.
**Why.** MediatR moved to a commercial licence. The functionality used here is
small, and owning it removes a dependency, a licence obligation, and a layer of
reflection that obscures stack traces.
**Consequences.** A small amount of infrastructure code to maintain and test.
New developers cannot rely on MediatR familiarity, so the dispatcher needs to
stay simple and documented.
