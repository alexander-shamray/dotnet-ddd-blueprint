# 12. Test strategy and TDD

## 12.1 The pyramid

```
      ╱╲            Cross-service — a few
     ╱  ╲           A whole saga, all services in containers. Seconds.

```

| Level | Scope | Dependencies | Target time | Count | Lives in |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Domain unit | One aggregate or value object | None — no mocks either | < 1 ms | Hundreds | `*.Domain.Tests` |
| Application | One handler end to end | Real DB and Redis (containers), fakes for other services | < 500 ms | Tens | `*.Application.Tests` |
| API contract | HTTP in, HTTP out | `WebApplicationFactory` + containers | < 1 s | Tens | `*.Api.Tests` |
| Host building block | One middleware or host extension | `TestServer` — no containers, no entry point | < 50 ms | Tens | `Common.Web.Tests` |
| Edge configuration | The route file of §10.2 against the host that loaded it, and §10.1's edge behaviours — compression and the body ceiling | `WebApplicationFactory` + a stub destination on loopback — no containers, and `UseKestrel` where the property under test is the server's own | < 1 s | One suite | `Gateway.Api.Tests` |
| Outbound hop | §9.7's one synchronous call: the timeout hierarchy read off the built host, the credential handler's position inside the resilience pipeline, and §11.5's realm | `WebApplicationFactory` + a real gRPC server on loopback; one class also runs a real Keycloak | < 1 s, and seconds for the Keycloak class | One suite | `Web.Bff.Tests` |
| Pipeline behaviour | One §6.3 behaviour against recording fakes — the branches its handler-level tests cannot reach | None | < 10 ms | One suite per behaviour | `Common.Application.Tests` |
| Saga | One whole saga, coordination only | MassTransit in-memory harness — no infrastructure | < 100 ms per positive assertion (§12.5) | A few | `*.Application.Tests` |
| Contract shape | Every published contract against the rules it must obey | Both assemblies, reflection only | < 1 s | One suite | `Platform.IntegrationTests` |

**Neither is there an "all services in containers" level, nor an E2E one.** Both
are rows that get written into a strategy and never built — the second needs a
client the backend does not own and data that survives between runs; the first
needs every service's image, database and broker started together, which is a
local Compose environment wearing a test-runner costume and fails in ways nobody
can attribute.

What they would actually catch splits cleanly in two, and both halves are
cheaper elsewhere. **Saga coordination** — did the right command go out, in the
right order, after the right event — is exercised by the in-memory harness in
§12.5, in milliseconds. The exception is an assertion that something did *not*
happen, which cannot resolve until the harness gives up waiting and so costs
the whole inactivity timeout — once per test, however many negatives it
asserts. §12.5's traps price that and name the correctness hazard that comes
with it, and between them they are the reason these tests are "a few" rather
than hundreds. **Contract compatibility** —
does the message one service publishes still mean what its consumers expect —
is a reflection test over the contract assembly, and it is why
`Platform.IntegrationTests` exists and holds nothing else. It is **not the
only thing genuinely between services** — §9.7's one synchronous hop is the
other, and §12.6 tests the two in almost opposite ways. The hop is
deliberately not in this suite: a contract over it needs the provider
running, so it lives in the provider's own suite rather than buying a sixth
project a container set.

What no level above covers is whether the *deployed* system responds under load
and against real infrastructure. That is the **k6 run against staging**
([§13.7](13-observability.md)) — `deploy/observability/slo/slo.js` — asserting
the SLO rows it can evaluate; not a test suite, and [§15.1](15-cicd-deployment.md) stages it as
what it is. **One tool, named**: this said "k6 or NBomber" until §13.7 picked
one, on the grounds that a stage naming two tools names none.

Naming it accurately is the point: a load run that is honestly a load run gets
maintained; an "E2E suite" that is actually three fragile scripts gets disabled
after the second flake and stays green forever.

Every row above names a project **and has an example in this section**. Both
halves are the rule: a level with no home is a level nobody writes, and a level
whose home is empty is one nobody notices is missing.

**How to run them is `docs/testing.md`**, deliberately not this chapter: the
commands, the `Category=Integration` filter of §12.4, which five projects need
a Docker daemon and what the coverage figure of §12.9 is measured over. This
chapter decides what to test and that file decides how to run it, and the
second goes stale on a different clock — a new runner flag changes nothing
about the pyramid. Where they disagree, this chapter wins.

> **A suite that never ran looks exactly like a suite that passed.** `dotnet
> test` discovers through a VSTest adapter, and `xunit.v3` does not carry one:
> `xunit.runner.visualstudio` is a separate package ([Appendix B](appendix-b-licences.md)).

> turns red about.

## 12.2 The TDD cycle applied

Red, green, refactor — with a worked example, because the discipline is easier
to describe than to follow.

**Requirement:** an order cannot be cancelled once it has shipped.

**Red** — write the test first. It must fail for the right reason.

```csharp
public class OrderCancellationTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Cannot_cancel_an_order_that_has_shipped()
    {
        Order order = OrderBuilder.Shipped();

        Action act = () => order.Cancel(CancellationReason.CustomerRequest, DateTimeOffset.UtcNow);

        act
            .ShouldThrow<DomainException>()
            .Message.ShouldContain("cannot be cancelled");
    }
}
```

Run it. It fails because `Cancel` does not check status yet — not because
`OrderBuilder.Shipped()` does not compile. A test failing to compile is not a
red test; make it compile first, then watch it fail.

> **Test names are sentences, and that costs exactly one analyser rule.** CA1707
> forbids underscores in member names and [ADR-019](appendix-a-adrs.md#adr-019--warnings-are-errors-and-the-editorconfig-is-a-build-input)
> makes every warning an error, so the name above fails the build until the rule
> is turned off. `Directory.Build.props` turns it off for projects whose name
> ends `Tests` and nowhere else. The convention wins because a test name is read
> in a failure report by somebody who is not looking at the code, and
> `CannotCancelAnOrderThatHasShipped` is worse at that job than the underscores
> are at anything.

**Green** — the minimum change that passes:

```csharp
public void Cancel(CancellationReason reason, DateTimeOffset now)
{
    if (Status is OrderStatus.Shipped or OrderStatus.Delivered)
        throw new DomainException($"A {Status} order cannot be cancelled.");

    Status = OrderStatus.Cancelled;
    Raise(new OrderCancelledDomainEvent(Id, CustomerId, reason, now));
}
```

**Refactor** — with the test green, improve. Add the guidance about returns, and
add the idempotency case as its own test first:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Cancelling_twice_is_idempotent()
{
    Order order = OrderBuilder.AwaitingPayment();
    order.Cancel(CancellationReason.CustomerRequest, Now);

    order.Cancel(CancellationReason.CustomerRequest, Now);

    order.Status.ShouldBe(OrderStatus.Cancelled);
    order.DomainEvents.OfType<OrderCancelledDomainEvent>().Count().ShouldBe(1);
}
```

Why this order matters: writing the test first forces you to design the API from
the caller's perspective before the implementation biases you, and it proves the
test can fail. A test written after the code has never been observed failing,
and a test that cannot fail is not a test.

## 12.3 Domain tests — no mocks

The domain has no dependencies, so its tests need no test doubles. This is the
payoff for the dependency rule in section 4.2.

```csharp
public class OrderTests
{
    private static readonly DateTimeOffset Now = new(2026, 8, 1, 12, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero);

    [Fact]
    public void Placing_an_order_totals_all_lines()
    {
        var order = Order.Place(
            new CustomerId(Guid.CreateVersion7()),
            AddressBuilder.Valid(),
            [
                (ProductId.New(), 2, Money.Of(10.00m, "EUR")),
                (ProductId.New(), 1, Money.Of(5.50m, "EUR"))
            ],
            "EUR",
            Now);

        order.Total.ShouldBe(Money.Of(25.50m, "EUR"));
        order.Status.ShouldBe(OrderStatus.AwaitingStock);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Placing_an_order_raises_OrderPlacedDomainEvent()
    {
        Order order = OrderBuilder.Placed();

        OrderPlacedDomainEvent placed = order.DomainEvents
            .OfType<OrderPlacedDomainEvent>().ShouldHaveSingleItem();
        placed.OrderId.ShouldBe(order.Id);
        placed.Total.ShouldBe(order.Total);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void An_order_must_have_at_least_one_line()
    {
        Action act = () => Order.Place(new CustomerId(Guid.CreateVersion7()), AddressBuilder.Valid(), [], "EUR", Now);

        act.ShouldThrow<DomainException>();
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Adding_the_same_product_twice_merges_the_lines()
    {
        var product = ProductId.New();

        var order = Order.Place(
            new CustomerId(Guid.CreateVersion7()),
            AddressBuilder.Valid(),
            [
                (product, 2, Money.Of(10m, "EUR")),
                (product, 3, Money.Of(10m, "EUR"))
            ],
            "EUR",
            Now);

        OrderLine line = order.Lines.ShouldHaveSingleItem();
        line.Quantity.ShouldBe(5);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void All_lines_must_share_the_order_currency()
    {
        Action act = () => Order.Place(
            new CustomerId(Guid.CreateVersion7()),
            AddressBuilder.Valid(),
            [
                (ProductId.New(), 1, Money.Of(10m, "USD"))
            ],
            "EUR",
            Now);

        act
            .ShouldThrow<DomainException>()
            .Message.ShouldContain("currency");
    }
}
```

Test data uses builders with sensible defaults, so each test states only what it
cares about:

```csharp
internal static class OrderBuilder
{
    private static readonly DateTimeOffset DefaultNow =
        new(2026, 8, 1, 12, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero);

    // The customer is a parameter because ownership tests have to name it —
    // §12.4's 404-not-403 case turns entirely on who owns the order.
    public static Order Placed(int lines = 1, string currency = "EUR", CustomerId? customer = null) =>
        Order.Place(
            customer ?? new CustomerId(Guid.CreateVersion7()),
            AddressBuilder.Valid(),
            Enumerable
                .Range(0, lines)
                .Select(_ => (ProductId.New(), 1, Money.Of(10m, currency))),
            currency, DefaultNow);

    public static Order AwaitingPayment()
    {
        Order order = Placed();
        order.ConfirmStock(DefaultNow);
        return order;
    }

    public static Order Shipped()
    {
        Order order = AwaitingPayment();
        order.ConfirmPayment(PaymentReference.Of("test-ref"), DefaultNow);
        order.MarkShipped(TrackingNumber.Of("TRK1"), DefaultNow);
        return order;
    }
}
```

## 12.4 Application tests — real infrastructure

> **Decision — integration tests use real SQL Server and Redis, not in-memory
> substitutes.** See [ADR-010](appendix-a-adrs.md#adr-010--testcontainers-not-in-memory-providers).

The EF Core in-memory provider does not enforce foreign keys, does not
implement `rowversion` concurrency, and translates LINQ differently from the SQL
Server provider. A test suite green against it will still fail in production.
Testcontainers starts a real SQL Server in a few seconds; the fidelity is worth
it.

```csharp
public sealed class ServiceFixture : IAsyncLifetime
{
    private readonly MsSqlContainer _sql = new MsSqlBuilder()
        .WithImage("mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest")
        .Build();

    // Two Redis containers, matching the production split in §8.1 — otherwise
    // the tests cannot catch a coordination key written to the evicting instance.
    private readonly RedisContainer _cache = new RedisBuilder()
        .WithImage("redis:7-alpine")
        .WithCommand("--maxmemory-policy", "allkeys-lru")
        .Build();

    private readonly RedisContainer _coordination = new RedisBuilder()
        .WithImage("redis:7-alpine")
        .WithCommand("--maxmemory-policy", "noeviction")
        .Build();

    // 4.1 rather than a floating 4, because that is the base tag §14.1's
    // broker Dockerfile builds from and this fixture's whole claim is that a
    // test and a developer machine cannot disagree about the engine.
    //
    // A service that SCHEDULES cannot use a tag at all. Since ADR-021 §14.1
    // builds the broker rather than pulling it, and the delayed exchange lives
    // in a plugin no official image carries — so Ordering's fixture builds the
    // same Dockerfile through ImageFromDockerfileBuilder and runs the result.
    // The failure that forces it is a quiet one: a stock broker connects and
    // reports healthy, because the exchange is not declared until something
    // schedules, and the schedule that does then HANGS on a declare the broker
    // refuses. ADR-021 has the measurement.
    private readonly RabbitMqContainer _rabbit = new RabbitMqBuilder()
        .WithImage("rabbitmq:4.1-management-alpine")
        .Build();

    public WebApplicationFactory<Program> Factory { get; private set; } = null!;
    private Respawner _respawner = null!;

    // ValueTask, not Task: xUnit v3 redefined IAsyncLifetime (see below).
    public async ValueTask InitializeAsync()
    {
        await Task.WhenAll(_sql.StartAsync(), _cache.StartAsync(), _coordination.StartAsync(), _rabbit.StartAsync());

        Factory = new WebApplicationFactory<Program>()
            .WithWebHostBuilder(b => b
                .UseSetting("ConnectionStrings:Ordering", _sql.GetConnectionString())
                .UseSetting("ConnectionStrings:RedisCache", _cache.GetConnectionString())
                .UseSetting("ConnectionStrings:RedisCoordination", _coordination.GetConnectionString())
                .UseSetting("ConnectionStrings:RabbitMq", _rabbit.GetConnectionString())
                // AddJwtAuthentication reads this key eagerly and throws
                // naming it (§11.3), so the fixture supplies it for the same
                // reason it supplies the connection strings: without it the
                // host does not start, InitializeAsync throws, and every test
                // in the suite fails before it runs. Deliberately fake and
                // deliberately unreachable — .invalid never resolves, so a
                // test that accidentally dials the authority fails loudly
                // rather than reaching a real identity provider.
                //
                // Not ValidateOnStart and not OptionsValidationException,
                // which is what this comment said until PR-16 wrote the code:
                // §15.4 keeps ServiceIdentityOptions as the solution's only
                // options type, so there is no options class here to validate.
                //
                // No Identity:Client here. Ordering does not call a peer, so it
                // never binds ServiceIdentityOptions (§9.7) and supplying one
                // would be config the host ignores — which is how a fixture
                // ends up disagreeing with the deployment about what a service
                // requires, in the direction that hides a missing secret.
                .UseSetting("Identity:Authority", "https://identity.invalid/realms/test")
                .ConfigureServices(services =>
                {
                    // Replace the JWT scheme rather than configuring it: the
                    // endpoints under test are behind RequireAuthorization
                    // (§11.4), and the alternative is either 401 on every call
                    // or a fixture that fetches OIDC metadata over the network.
                    // TestAuthHandler issues the principal each test asks for,
                    // including its permission claims, so the authorization
                    // policies are exercised for real.
                    // Only authenticate and challenge are set, and forbid
                    // follows the challenge one — DefaultForbidScheme is unset,
                    // and the scheme provider falls back to
                    // DefaultChallengeScheme before DefaultScheme. So the 403
                    // comes from TestAuthHandler's inherited forbid, which is a
                    // bare status code touching no metadata, and the
                    // wrong-permission test needs no identity provider either.
                    services.Configure<AuthenticationOptions>(o =>
                    {
                        o.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = TestAuthHandler.SchemeName;
                        o.DefaultChallengeScheme = TestAuthHandler.SchemeName;

The test scheme itself. Tests state who they are in headers, so authorization
runs against a real principal rather than being switched off:

```csharp

    IOptionsMonitor<AuthenticationSchemeOptions> options,
    ILoggerFactory logger,
    UrlEncoder encoder)
    : AuthenticationHandler<AuthenticationSchemeOptions>(options, logger, encoder)

    // protected Scheme — the AuthenticationScheme this handler was resolved
    // for — so a constant of that name hides it, and CS0108 is an error under
    // ADR-019's TreatWarningsAsErrors. This sample said Scheme until PR-16
    // compiled it.
    public const string SchemeName = "Test";
    public const string UserHeader = "X-Test-User";
    public const string PermissionsHeader = "X-Test-Permissions";

    protected override Task<AuthenticateResult> HandleAuthenticateAsync()
    {
        // No header means anonymous, not "authenticated as nobody" — otherwise
        // every 401 test silently passes.
        if (!Request.Headers.TryGetValue(UserHeader, out StringValues userId))
            return Task.FromResult(AuthenticateResult.NoResult());

        List<Claim> claims = [new(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, userId.ToString())];

        // The same claim type §11.4's policies require. A test that grants
        // itself "orders:cancel" is exercising the policy, not bypassing it.
        if (Request.Headers.TryGetValue(PermissionsHeader, out StringValues granted))
        {
            claims.AddRange(
                granted
                    .ToString()

                    .Select(p => new Claim(PermissionClaim.Type, p)));
        }

        ClaimsPrincipal principal = new(new ClaimsIdentity(claims, SchemeName));
        return Task.FromResult(
            AuthenticateResult.Success(new AuthenticationTicket(principal, SchemeName)));
    }
}

`A_command_id_claimed_by_one_customer_does_not_replay_to_another` is the one
test here whose failure is a **disclosure** rather than a defect: an unscoped
key does not throw, log or answer slowly — it answers 200 with another
customer's order id, to a caller authentication and the endpoint policy have
already admitted. Those two still run on a replay; what does not is the handler,
and with it §11.4's binding of the subject from the principal. That is why the
assertion is `ShouldNotBe` against the first caller's value and not
`IsSuccess.ShouldBeTrue()`.

**Three dispatches rather than two, and the third is the one that carries the
claim.** `ShouldNotBe` establishes only that the key varies with *something*;
a key scoped by a correlation id would satisfy it, and so would a pipeline with
no `IdempotencyBehavior` in it at all — which §6.3's registration-order test
is what catches, since §8.5 says plainly that neither of its reflection tests
reaches the behaviour. Returning to the first subject and getting the
first order back is what identifies the varying segment as the subject. The row
count sits beside all three: two callers, two orders, and the replay adds
none.

The dispatcher gets its own tests, driven explicitly rather than by waiting on a
timer. These are the ones that cover the behaviour §13.6 alerts on — per-row
isolation and attempt accounting — and neither is observable from a test that
lets the background service run:

```csharp
[Collection(nameof(IntegrationCollection))]
public class OutboxDispatcherTests(ServiceFixture fixture) : IAsyncLifetime
{
    public ValueTask InitializeAsync() => new(fixture.ResetAsync());
    public ValueTask DisposeAsync() => ValueTask.CompletedTask;

    [Fact]
    public async Task A_failing_row_does_not_block_healthy_rows()
    {
        await fixture.StageOutboxAsync(
            OutboxRows.Poison(fixture),          // its handler always throws
            OutboxRows.Healthy(fixture),
            OutboxRows.Healthy(fixture));

        await fixture.ProcessOutboxBatchAsync();

        IReadOnlyList<OutboxMessage> rows = await fixture.OutboxAsync();

        rows.Count(r => r.ProcessedAt is not null).ShouldBe(2);

        OutboxMessage poison = rows.Single(r => r.ProcessedAt is null);
        poison.Attempts.ShouldBe(1);
        poison.LastError.ShouldNotBeNullOrEmpty();
        poison.LockedUntil.ShouldNotBeNull();     // backed off, not abandoned
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task A_row_stops_being_claimed_at_the_attempt_cap()

        await fixture.SetOutboxAttemptsAsync(poison.MessageId, 9);

        (await fixture.ProcessOutboxBatchAsync()).ShouldBe(0);   // 9 → 10

        // Clear the backoff lease, so the second pass is blocked by the
        // attempt cap and nothing else. Without this the test would pass
        // even if the cap were removed entirely.
        await fixture.ExpireOutboxLeasesAsync();

        (await fixture.ProcessOutboxBatchAsync()).ShouldBe(0);

        OutboxMessage row = (await fixture.OutboxAsync()).Single();
        row.Attempts.ShouldBe(10);                // not 11 — never re-claimed
        row.ProcessedAt.ShouldBeNull();           // visible to the §13.6 alert
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task A_local_row_with_no_registered_handler_fails_loudly()
    {
        await fixture.StageOutboxAsync(OutboxRows.Unhandled(fixture));

        await fixture.ProcessOutboxBatchAsync();

        OutboxMessage row = (await fixture.OutboxAsync()).Single();
        row.ProcessedAt.ShouldBeNull();           // NOT silently completed
        row.LastError.ShouldContain("IProjectionHandler");
    }
}
```

The third test is the one worth keeping forever. It asserts the failure mode
that would otherwise be invisible: a projection that never runs while every
dashboard stays green.

Contract messages come from a builder rather than inline object initialisers.
`required` members make partial construction a compile error, so every test
would otherwise repeat eight assignments to vary one:

```csharp
internal static class Contracts
{
    // A fixed instant, as the outbox builders below use: OccurredAt is what
    // §13.7's delivery lag is measured from, and a builder reaching for the
    // system clock would have every test assert against a lag it just made.
    private static readonly DateTimeOffset Raised = new(2026, 8, 11, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero);

    public static V1.OrderPlaced OrderPlaced(Guid orderId, decimal total = 25.00m, string currency = "EUR") => new()
    {
        MessageId = Guid.CreateVersion7(),
        CorrelationId = orderId,
        OccurredAt = Raised,
        OrderId = orderId,
        CustomerId = Guid.CreateVersion7(),
        TotalAmount = total,
        Currency = currency,
        Lines = [new V1.PlacedLine(SeedData.ProductId, 1, total)]
    };
}
```

The builders those tests use are ordinary factories over `OutboxMessage`
([Appendix D](appendix-d-type-inventory.md)), one class rather than one per
case — they differ only in which event they stage, and three classes with a
`Row` method each said that three times:

```csharp
// The map and the payload format are the real ones, resolved from the
// fixture's provider (§9.4). A double for either would let a test stage a row
// the running host cannot read back, which is the one thing these builders
// exist to prove does not happen.
public static class OutboxRows
{
    // A fixed instant, not the system clock: OccurredAt is what §13.7's
    // projection lag is measured from, and a test that staged "now" would
    // assert against a lag it had just created.
    private static readonly DateTimeOffset Raised = new(2026, 8, 11, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero);

    public static OutboxMessage Poison(ServiceFixture fixture) =>
        Local(new AlwaysThrows { OccurredAt = Raised }, fixture);

    public static OutboxMessage Healthy(ServiceFixture fixture) =>
        Local(new NoOpEvent { OccurredAt = Raised }, fixture);

    public static OutboxMessage Unhandled(ServiceFixture fixture) =>
        Local(new UnhandledEvent { OccurredAt = Raised }, fixture);

    // The fixture rather than the map alone, because a staged row needs both
    // halves of the host's agreement about the format: the persisted name and
    // the converters. A row written without the Money converter round-trips
    // to a zero amount and a null currency.
    private static OutboxMessage Local(object message, ServiceFixture fixture) =>
        OutboxMessage.Stage(
            message,
            OutboxLane.Local,
            Guid.CreateVersion7(),
            fixture.MessageTypes,
            fixture.OutboxJson);
}
```

`AlwaysThrows` has a registered `IProjectionHandler<AlwaysThrows>` that throws;
`NoOpEvent` has one that does nothing; `UnhandledEvent` has none, which is
precisely what the third test exercises. All three are `IDomainEvent`
implementations in the test assembly, so the fixture registers that assembly
before the map is built — one line beside the `TestAuthHandler` replacement:

```csharp
// §9.4. Adding, not replacing: the production assemblies stay, so a test
// cannot stage a type the real host would refuse. Without this, NameOf throws
// on the first builder call and every outbox test fails before its assertion.
//
// The registered instance is mutated, not re-registered. Constructing a second
// source here would compile, pass, and quietly restate the production list —
// so the day §4.2 gains an assembly, this line is a copy that no longer
// matches and nothing points at it. MessageTypeSource is mutable for exactly
// this, and the map is built from it on first resolve.
services
    .Single(d => d.ServiceType == typeof(MessageTypeSource))
    .ImplementationInstance
    .ShouldBeSource()
    .Add(typeof(AlwaysThrows).Assembly);
```

Two assertions belong beside these. The first is the cheapest guard on the
single-identity rule of [§9.1](09-messaging.md), and it takes no fixture at all — the thing that
can regress is a pure function:

```csharp

The second is the `Local` lane's payload contract (§9.4). It needs no
containers, but it lives here rather than in §12.6 because the set it iterates
comes from the fixture's `MessageTypeMap` and §12.6 selects on the contracts
namespace, which no domain event is in:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Every_stageable_domain_event_round_trips_through_the_outbox_options()
{
    // Not "every IDomainEvent": the map is the set the outbox can actually
    // carry, and a type it does not know cannot reach a payload column.
    // The REGISTERED options, converters included. A hand-built OutboxJson
    // listing the service's converters would assert that they work — which
    // nobody doubts — and stay green if a registration were deleted, while the
    // running host wrote a zero-valued Money into every row. Registration is
    // what can silently go missing, so registration is what this resolves.
    JsonSerializerOptions options = fixture.OutboxJson.Options;

    foreach (Type type in fixture.MessageTypes.StageableDomainEvents)
    {
        object sample = DomainEventSamples.Create(type);
        string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(sample, type, options);

        JsonSerializer
            .Deserialize(json, type, options)
            .ShouldBeEquivalentTo(sample, $"{type.Name} cannot survive the Local lane");
    }
}
```

`DomainEventSamples.Create` is the same deliberate obstacle `ContractSamples` is
(§12.6): a new domain event with no sample fails here instead of being skipped,
which is the failure mode of every loop over types that falls back to
`Activator.CreateInstance`.

Containers start once per test collection, not per test. Truncating with
Respawn between tests keeps them isolated at a fraction of the cost.

> Catalog is where that shape is realised: both its suites take the fixture,
> which is exactly why the library exists.

### API contract tests

The pyramid's third level (§12.1) goes through HTTP, and it exists to cover
what the levels below it structurally cannot: the endpoint's authorization, its
status codes, and its serialisation. A handler test proves the decision; only
this proves the decision reaches the wire intact.

```csharp
[Collection(nameof(IntegrationCollection))]
public class CancelOrderEndpointTests(ServiceFixture fixture) : IAsyncLifetime
{
    private HttpClient _client = null!;

    public ValueTask InitializeAsync()
    {
        _client = fixture.Factory.CreateClient();

        HttpResponseMessage response = await SendAsAsync(Guid.CreateVersion7(), "orders:read", Guid.CreateVersion7());

    }

        response.StatusCode.ShouldBe(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task Rejects_a_reason_outside_the_wire_vocabulary()

        };

        request.Headers.Add(TestAuthHandler.PermissionsHeader, OrderingPermissions.Cancel);

        request.Headers.Add(TestAuthHandler.PermissionsHeader, permissions);

        return _client.SendAsync(request);
    }
}
```

Four tests, four distinct failures, none reachable from below the HTTP
boundary: an endpoint that lost its `RequireAuthorization` (401 becomes 200), a
policy name that resolves to nothing (403 becomes 200), a resource check
returning the wrong status (404 becomes 403, leaking existence), and a reason
parsed by `Enum.TryParse` instead of the wire vocabulary (400 becomes 200, and
the enum's member names quietly become API surface). Each is a defect this
document has argued about in prose and, until now, asserted nowhere.

### The subject rule, enforced

[§11.4](11-identity-authorization.md)'s subject rule is the kind of rule that
holds by omission — a command with no `CustomerId` field cannot be pointed at
another customer — and a rule that holds by omission is one a later refactor
reinstates without noticing. These five are what make it fail loudly instead.

`DispatchAsync` is the fixture helper above: it opens a scope, points that
scope's `TestCurrentUser` at the principal named, and dispatches. The double
itself is the part worth reading, because a simpler one breaks the HTTP suite:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The scoped ICurrentUser every test runs on, in three states.
/// </summary>
public sealed class TestCurrentUser(IHttpContextAccessor accessor) : ICurrentUser
{
    // Unset inside a request: the real seam — TestAuthHandler through
    // HttpContext through HttpContextCurrentUser, resolved exactly as
    // production resolves it, so §12.4's endpoint tests keep asserting on
    // the principal their headers named.
    //
    // Unset below HTTP: an authenticated stand-in, so a handler test that
    // says nothing about the caller still has one. Without this branch every
    // pre-existing dispatcher test would throw on currentUser.Id the moment
    // §6.4's handler started reading it.
    //
    // Set: whatever the test said. The only route to a handler with no
    // caller at all, which is the state RequireAuthorization stops a request
    // from ever producing (§11.4).
    private ICurrentUser? _stated;

    public void Set(ICurrentUser principal) => _stated = principal;

    private ICurrentUser Effective =>
        _stated ?? (accessor.HttpContext is not null
            ? new HttpContextCurrentUser(accessor)
            : Principals.Default);

    public bool IsAuthenticated => Effective.IsAuthenticated;

    public Guid Id => Effective.Id;

    public bool HasPermission(string permission) => Effective.HasPermission(permission);
}
```

`Principals` supplies the values that double answers from — two a test names
explicitly, and the one it falls back to when a test names none:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The principals a test can state, and the one it gets by stating none.
/// </summary>
public static class Principals
{
    // Fixed rather than a fresh subject per access: two dispatches in one test
    // that both say nothing about the caller have to agree about who it was, or
    // a read-after-write assertion fails for a reason the test never mentions.
    public static ICurrentUser Default { get; } = Authenticated(SeedData.CustomerId);

    // IsAuthenticated false and an Id that throws — the shape
    // HttpContextCurrentUser takes off the consumer path (§11.4), so a handler
    // reading Id without guarding fails here the way it fails in production.
    public static ICurrentUser Anonymous { get; } = new Principal(null, []);

    // params, so the subject tests name a caller and nothing else; the
    // permissions are what §11.4's orders:admin branch reads.
    public static ICurrentUser Authenticated(Guid subject, params string[] permissions) =>
        new Principal(subject, permissions);

    private sealed class Principal(Guid? subject, string[] permissions) : ICurrentUser
    {
        public bool IsAuthenticated => subject is not null;

        public Guid Id => subject ?? throw new InvalidOperationException(
            "No authenticated caller. Guard with IsAuthenticated.");

        public bool HasPermission(string permission) => permissions.Contains(permission);
    }
}
```

**`Anonymous` is a property and `Authenticated` a method**, which is what makes
`currentUser: Anonymous` and `currentUser: Authenticated(caller)` read as they
do above. The subject is nullable in one place only — inside `Principal`,
where the absence *is* the state being modelled.

**Delegating rather than replacing is the whole design**, and the flat version
is worth naming because it looks simpler and is wrong. A double that always
answers from its own field would make
`Hides_another_customers_order_behind_a_404` pass because the fixture's default
subject happens not to be the seeded owner — the right status for the wrong
reason, on the one test whose entire point is that the status is right — and
would strand every HTTP path that needs the header principal.

**A double is the right call here and §12.7's rule says so**, though it needs
reading twice to see it: `ICurrentUser` is a port over `HttpContext`, so the
thing being stood in for is infrastructure, exactly as `FakeTimeProvider` stands
in for the clock. What "mock only what you do not own" forbids is doubling the
repository underneath these tests, and none of them does — the orders are real
rows in a real database, seeded through the aggregate.

These five run at the dispatcher rather than over HTTP, and that is not a
shortcut. Two of them describe states HTTP cannot produce against §11.4's
endpoint group: `RequireAuthorization` turns a caller-less request into a 401
before any handler runs, so the fail-open the old guard admitted is invisible
from outside, and the compensation path has no HTTP surface at all. The
API-contract tests above cover the boundary; these cover the check.

**The last two tests are a pair and only mean something together.** One asserts
the check refuses a caller-less user command; the other asserts it still lets
the saga through. Either alone is satisfied by a handler that is simply wrong in
the other direction, and the direction that fails silently — refusing
compensations — surfaces as orders stuck in `AwaitingStock` long after the
deployment that caused it.

**Three of the five carry an origin, and each states it rather than earning
it.** The system case constructs `CommandOrigin.System` directly, which is the
right way to test the *check* — and it leaves the only production code that
assigns it, `CancelOrderMapper` (§9.4), unasserted. A mapper stamping `User`
would pass every test above and reject every real compensation — the failure
the pair was written to catch, arriving by the one route the pair cannot see.
Two short tests close it — the stamp, and the parse that stands in front of it:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void The_mapper_is_what_makes_a_message_system_initiated()
{
    CancelOrderCommand command = new CancelOrderMapper().Map(
        new CancelOrder(Guid.CreateVersion7(), CancelReasons.OutOfStock));

    // Both halves of what the mapper does. The stamp is the new one, but the
    // parse is the older claim and equally unasserted: every recognised code
    // could map to the wrong domain reason and this test would still pass on
    // the origin alone.
    command.InitiatedBy.ShouldBe(CommandOrigin.System);
    command.Reason.ShouldBe(CancellationReason.OutOfStock);
}

[Fact]
public void An_unknown_reason_code_never_becomes_a_command()
{
    // §9.4's retry policy ignores ContractMappingException, so this is what
    // sends a malformed message to the error queue on the first attempt
    // rather than after a minute of backoff. A parse that quietly accepted
    // the code would keep the test above green and lose that behaviour, and
    // nothing else in the suite looks at this branch.
    CancelOrder message = new(Guid.CreateVersion7(), "invented_last_release");

    Should.Throw<ContractMappingException>(() => new CancelOrderMapper().Map(message));
}
```

No `[Collection]` and no fixture: the mapper is a pure function, so this sits
beside `Stage_takes_the_message_id_from_the_envelope` above — same project, same
absence of infrastructure — rather than inside the container-backed class. It is
the second half of a boundary whose first half is the endpoint's literal, and
that half is already covered: the API-contract tests reach the handler through
HTTP, so they fail if `User` stops being stamped.

### Gateway configuration tests

The gateway's suite sits here rather than beside `Common.Web.Tests`, and the
distinction is the entry point: `Common.Web` is a library with none, so its
tests build a pipeline by hand, while the gateway is a host and the thing under
test is the configuration *that host* loaded. It is the one suite in this
section that starts no container — the edge owns no database
([§10.1](10-api-gateway.md)) — and the one that reads a shipped configuration
file as a subject rather than as setup.

Two of its assertions have no other home. The first is that the host accepted
every route in the file: policy names are resolved when
[§10.2](10-api-gateway.md)'s configuration loads, and a route whose id went in
and did not come out is a path that stopped existing.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Every_route_in_the_file_is_a_route_the_proxy_accepted()
{
    IReadOnlyList<RouteConfiguration> configured = ReadRoutes();
    IProxyStateLookup lookup = factory.Services.GetRequiredService<IProxyStateLookup>();

    string[] accepted = [.. lookup.GetRoutes().Select(r => r.Config.RouteId).Order(StringComparer.Ordinal)];

    accepted.ShouldBe([.. configured.Select(r => r.Id).Order(StringComparer.Ordinal)]);
}
```

The second is the prefix strip, and it is asserted against a request rather
than against the file that asks for it — a stub server on an ephemeral
loopback port, standing in for the service and recording the path it was
given:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task The_service_receives_the_path_with_the_namespace_prefix_removed()
{
    using StubbedGatewayFactory factory = new(stub.Address);
    using HttpClient client = factory.CreateClient();

    HttpResponseMessage response =
        await client.GetAsync("/api/v1/catalog/products", TestContext.Current.CancellationToken);

    response.StatusCode.ShouldBe(HttpStatusCode.NoContent);
    // The LAST path, not any path: the stub is a class fixture and a
    // neighbouring test sends this same path, so ShouldContain could pass on
    // that test's entry while this request was forwarded wrongly.
    stub.ReceivedPaths.Last().ShouldBe("/v1/catalog/products");
}
```

> **A listener, not an address that refuses.** The first version pointed the
> clusters at `127.0.0.1:1`, on the reasoning that a refused connection is free.
> Measured, it cost about two seconds a request — so exhausting §10.3's
> hundred-request window took three and a half minutes, the window replenished
> before the last request arrived, and the rate-limit test failed while the
> limiter was working perfectly. A stub that answers is faster *and* is the
> only thing that can observe the forwarded path.

> **One property in this suite cannot be asserted over `TestServer` at all**,
> and it is the case that says where the seam is. §10.1's body ceiling is a
> Kestrel option, and `TestServer` is not Kestrel — it implements none of the
> body-size features, so `ConfigureKestrel` is a no-op under it and the ceiling
> does not exist. `WebApplicationFactory.UseKestrel(0)` takes an ephemeral
> loopback port for the stub's reason, and the order is load-bearing: it throws

>

### The outbound hop

The pyramid's last row is `Web.Bff.Tests`, and it exists because §9.7's one
synchronous call has three properties no other suite can reach: a timeout
hierarchy, a credential handler's *position*, and a realm that nothing
compiles against.

The hierarchy is read off the **built host** rather than recomputed from the
numbers a helper returns — which is what makes it a test of the registration:

```csharp
HttpStandardResilienceOptions options = factory.Services
    .GetRequiredService<IOptionsMonitor<HttpStandardResilienceOptions>>()
    .Get(PricingHop.ResilienceOptionsName);

(attempts + backoff).ShouldBeLessThanOrEqualTo(options.TotalRequestTimeout.Timeout);
```

It is also self-checking about the options name, which is why §9.7 registers a
**named** client: ask for the wrong key and `IOptionsMonitor` hands back a
default instance whose 30 s total timeout fails this assertion at once, rather
than a configuration that silently was never read.

The credential handler's position is the harder one, because both orderings
compile, start and serve. It is observable only through a stub that records
what arrived:

```csharp
_catalog.AbortNextCalls = 1;                  // a transport fault — see below

await client.GetFromJsonAsync<QuoteResponse>(Quote);

presented.ShouldBe(["Bearer token-1", "Bearer token-2"]);
```

> **Two attempts, two *different* tokens, and a constant token would make the
> correct pipeline and the reversed one produce identical bytes.** That is the
> whole assertion: registered outside the resilience handler, the credential
> handler runs once per request rather than once per attempt, and both lines
> read `token-1`.
>
> **The fault has to be a transport one**, and that is not a detail of the
> stub. A gRPC outcome travels as `grpc-status` on an HTTP **200**, so the
> resilience pipeline reads it as success and retries nothing — a stubbed
> `Unavailable` produces one attempt and measures neither ordering. Only an
> aborted connection reaches the retry. §9.7's callout carries the same point
> from the other side.

The realm is the third, and it is the one suite in the solution that starts a
real Keycloak (§11.5). Everything else points at an unreachable authority on
purpose, so an audience mapper missing from the realm export is invisible to
every other test here — nothing compiles differently when it is gone.

## 12.5 Testing the saga

Saga logic is where cross-service bugs live, and MassTransit's in-memory test
harness makes it testable without any infrastructure at all.

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Payment_declined_releases_stock_before_cancelling()
{
    await using ServiceProvider provider = new ServiceCollection()
        .AddMassTransitTestHarness(x =>
        {
            // 60 and 10, and the ceiling is deliberately six times the bound
            // meant to fire. 30 is MassTransit's OWN default for testTimeout,
            // so a sample setting it there states nothing and inherits the
            // number the trap below is about — this line read 30 while the
            // suite it specifies ran 60.
            x.SetTestTimeouts(testTimeout: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60), testInactivityTimeout: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
            // The same two lines production registers (ADR-021), and they are
            // not optional here: §9.6's Initially arms StockTimeout, so the
            // first OrderPlaced reaches for a scheduler. The in-memory
            // transport implements the delay itself where RabbitMQ needs a
            // plugin — the transports differ and the registration under test
            // does not.
            x.AddDelayedMessageScheduler();
            x
                .AddSagaStateMachine<OrderFulfilmentSaga, OrderFulfilmentState>()
                .InMemoryRepository();
            x.UsingInMemory((context, cfg) =>
            {
                cfg.UseDelayedMessageScheduler();
                cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
            });
        })
        .BuildServiceProvider(true);

    ITestHarness harness = provider.GetRequiredService<ITestHarness>();
    await harness.Start();

    var orderId = Guid.CreateVersion7();

    // Every member of every V1 contract is `required` — the §9.1 envelope
    // included — so there is no partial construction to elide anywhere here,
    // and a builder keeps that from filling the test. `new StockReserved
    // { OrderId = orderId }` does not compile: the three envelope members are
    // as required as the payload, which is the point of §9.1 declaring them on
    // an interface rather than leaving them to convention.
    // `Publish` here is the suite's helper, not `harness.Bus.Publish`: it
    // returns only once the saga has consumed the message, so the ordering
    // below is its job and not the caller's. The `Sent` lines are assertions
    // — each names the command a transition owes — and three bare
    // `harness.Bus.Publish` calls in their place would be the race the trap
    // below prices.
    await Publish(harness, Contracts.OrderPlaced(orderId));
    (await harness.Sent.Any<ReserveStock>(m => m.Context.Message.OrderId == orderId))

    // Sent, not Published — the saga issues these as commands to a single
    // owner (§9.6). The harness tracks the two separately, so asserting on
    // Published here would fail while looking like a saga defect.
    (await harness.Sent.Any<ReleaseStock>(m => m.Context.Message.OrderId == orderId))
        .ShouldBeTrue();

    // CancelOrder must not be sent until stock is confirmed released — and
    // "not yet" needs a point in time to be false *at*. The `Publish` above
    // IS that point: it returned only once the saga had consumed
    // PaymentDeclined, which is why no `Consumed` assertion stands here. It
    // used to, and the barrier moving into the helper is what retired it.
    //
    // An already-cancelled token then reads the record as of that point: no
    // wait, no deadline for a late saga to hide inside, and the harness's one
    // shared inactivity token left unspent for the assertion after
    // StockReleased. The traps below explain why each of those matters.
    using CancellationTokenSource asRecorded = new();
    asRecorded.Cancel();

    (await harness.Sent.Any<CancelOrder>(m => m.Context.Message.OrderId == orderId, asRecorded.Token))
        .ShouldBeFalse();

    await Publish(harness, Contracts.StockReleased(orderId));

    // The reason, not just the send. Both exits from Compensating read
    // ctx.Saga.CancelReason (§9.6), so a transition that forgets to set it on
    // entry produces a CancelOrder carrying null — which this assertion fails
    // on and `Any<CancelOrder>` alone would not.
    (await harness.Sent.Any<CancelOrder>(m =>

    // The last assertion here is a negative — and the ONE negative in a saga

    // not close.

## 12.6 Contract tests

The saga tests above prove one service's coordination. **Two things are
genuinely *between* services**, and they are tested in almost opposite ways: the
contract assembly, whose rules are about *shape* and hold for every contract
there will ever be, and [§9.7](09-messaging.md)'s one synchronous hop, whose
rules are about *behaviour* and are one consumer's. The first is below; the
second is the consumer-driven contract at the end of this section.

The contract assembly's rules are all stated elsewhere as things reviewers
should notice: §9.1's "a contract may not name a domain type", §9.2's versioned
namespace, `required` members. Each is mechanical, so each is a test rather than
a review note.

This is the one suite that references every service, which is why it has its own
project and why that project holds nothing else:

```csharp
public class ContractTests
{
    // Concrete types only. The assembly also holds IIntegrationEvent (§9.1)
    // and the static code vocabularies (CancelReasons, ReviewReasons), and a
    // filter of "everything public under Common.Contracts" would demand a
    // versioned namespace of an interface that is deliberately shared across
    // all of them — and then ask ContractSamples for an instance of it.
    private static readonly Type[] Contracts =
    [
        .. typeof(OrderPlaced).Assembly.GetTypes().Where(IsContract)
    ];

    // The ROOT namespace is included, and a trailing dot is what excluded it.
    // `StartsWith("Common.Contracts.")` reads as "everything in the assembly"
    // and is not: a concrete type declared straight into `Common.Contracts`,
    // with no version namespace at all, falls outside discovery — so it
    // bypasses the versioned-namespace check, the sample check and the
    // round-trip, and leaves the suite green over the one mistake §9.2 exists
    // to reject. Exposed as a method so a positive control can ask it about a
    // type declared, in the *test* assembly, in exactly that namespace.
    //
    // IsVisible, not IsPublic, and that is a second hole of the same kind:
    // IsPublic is false for EVERY nested type, including one declared `public`
    // inside a public class — those report IsNestedPublic. A contract nested in
    // a public type is as reachable by a consumer as any other and fell out of
    // discovery entirely. IsVisible asks the question actually meant: can
    // something outside this assembly name it.
    internal static bool IsContract(Type type) =>
        type.IsVisible &&
        type is { IsInterface: false, IsAbstract: false } &&
        type.Namespace is string ns &&
        (ns == "Common.Contracts" || ns.StartsWith("Common.Contracts.", StringComparison.Ordinal));

    [Fact]
    public void No_contract_names_a_domain_type()
    {
        // §9.1's rule, and the one that silently drags Ordering.Domain into
        // every consuming service. Checked at the assembly level because a
        // contract cannot reference a domain type without the reference.
        typeof(OrderPlaced).Assembly
            .GetReferencedAssemblies()
            .Select(a => a.Name!)
            .ShouldNotContain(name => name.EndsWith(".Domain", StringComparison.Ordinal));
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Every_contract_lives_in_a_versioned_namespace()
    {
        // Common.Contracts.<Service>.V<n> — §9.2. A contract that lands one
        // namespace short is a v1 that can never be superseded.
        Contracts.ShouldAllBe(t =>
            Regex.IsMatch(t.Namespace!, @"^Common\.Contracts\.[A-Za-z]+\.V\d+$"));
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Every_contract_round_trips_through_the_bus_serialiser()
    {
        // Catches the member type System.Text.Json cannot handle — the failure
        // that otherwise appears as a message in the error queue, in staging,
        // with a deserialisation stack trace and no obvious owner.
        foreach (Type type in Contracts)
        {
            object instance = ContractSamples.Create(type);
            string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(instance, type);
            object? returned = JsonSerializer.Deserialize(json, type);

            JsonSerializer.Serialize(returned, type).ShouldBe(json, type.FullName);
        }
    }
}

That comparison has one blind spot, and it takes a second assertion rather than
a cleverer first one: a member that fails to serialise **at all** is absent from
both forms, so the contract silently loses a field and the round-trip passes. So
a companion test asks the type for its public instance properties and requires
every one of them to appear in the JSON — which is also what fails when a member
is added to a record and not to its sample.

`ContractSamples.Create` is the reason this suite stays honest as contracts
grow. Every member of a V1 contract is `required` (§12.5), so there is no
reflection shortcut that constructs one — a new contract without a sample fails
here rather than being quietly skipped, which is the failure mode of every
"iterate over all the types" test that defaults to `Activator.CreateInstance`.

Two assertions guard the registry itself, in both directions. A contract with no
sample fails **by name**, in its own test, rather than as one message from the
middle of a round-trip loop; and a sample naming a type that is no longer a
public contract fails too, which is the direction throwing cannot catch — that
entry compiles until the type is deleted and is dead weight from the moment the
contract was renamed.

**The third rule this suite claims — `required` members — needs an assertion of
its own, because no serialisation test can see it.** Dropping `required` from a
contract property changes no JSON, so the round-trip and the wire-member check
both stay green; what it changes is a producer's ability to omit the member, and
every consumer's reading a default when one does. The rule is really *there is
no way to build one incompletely*, and two shapes satisfy it: a positional
record takes its values in a primary constructor and needs no `required` at all,
while a property-based record can be built by `new()` and needs every property
marked. So the assertion applies to the shape with the hole — a contract with a
public parameterless constructor must mark every settable property.

### Consumer-driven contracts

Everything above is about the *shape* of a contract, and none of it reaches
[§9.7](09-messaging.md)'s hop. `pricing.proto` already pins that shape — one
file, two generated halves, so a field cannot be renamed on one side only. What
it cannot pin is what the fields **mean**: that an unpriced product is absent
rather than zero, that the amount is text to be parsed rather than compared,
that a reply's currency is the amount's own label. `pricing.proto` says all
three, in comments, and until PR-26 nothing checked any of them across the
boundary.

**What stood in for a check was a stub, and a stub is a second specification
nobody verifies.** `Web.Bff.Tests` drives its endpoint against `StubCatalog`, a
hand-written gRPC server modelling Catalog. Four of its behaviours had drifted
from the service it models — it filtered currency case-sensitively where Catalog
does not, echoed the request's spelling of the currency rather than its own
stored one, formatted amounts at the test's scale rather than the column's
`decimal(19,4)`, and enforced no request ceiling at all.

> **The consumer's guard against the drift was itself unguarded, and that was

So the consumer writes down what it needs, and the provider is verified against
it. The expectations are **one file** — `PricingContract.cs`, in the consumer's
own test-support project — compiled into `Web.Bff.Tests` and **linked** into
`Catalog.Api.Tests`, exactly as `pricing.proto` is linked into `Web.Bff`. The
syntactic contract and the semantic one are then shared the same way, and
neither is an assembly, so [§4.3](04-solution-structure.md) keeps
`Common.Contracts` as its one exception.

```csharp
new PricingInteraction(
    "a product priced in another currency is absent rather than zero",
    [Chair, Lamp],
    ["chair", "lamp"],
    0,
    "GBP",
    PricingOutcome.Prices("chair"))
```

An interaction names its products by **alias** rather than by id, because
neither side can be handed one: the stub mints its ids and the provider suite
publishes through `POST /v1/catalog/products` and is given them back. Each side
realises the state its own way and binds the alias.

**What the contract builds once is the *question*, not the message**, and the
difference is deliberate. The ids and the currency come from
`PricingContract.RequestedIds` on both sides, so the stub and the real service
are asked about the same products in the same currency. Only the provider suite
then sends that as a `GetPricesRequest`; the consumer suite hands it to the
screen as a query string and lets `CheckoutEndpoints` build the gRPC message
itself. Having the contract build it there would verify the contract against
itself — the consumer's half exists precisely to establish that the request the
*endpoint* constructs is the one the contract describes.

The per-field tolerance is stated once and applied to every answered
interaction, on both sides. It is the **consumer's** tolerance and not the
provider's behaviour, which is what keeps a contract from over-specifying: the
amount is parsed and compared numerically, never matched as text, because
Catalog's column scale reaches the wire as `49.9900` and a migration that
changed it would change nothing a customer can see.

The one number the contract does state is the request ceiling, and it is stated
in **both** directions: a basket at `MaxProductIds` must be served, and one past
it must be refused with `InvalidArgument` — the status
`UpstreamExceptionHandler` turns into the caller's 400. Either interaction
alone is satisfiable by a provider that has quietly moved the limit, so the pair
is what pins it, and a change in either direction fails verification on purpose.
That is not a contradiction of `CheckoutEndpoints` holding no ceiling of its
own: production code with a copy would refuse requests Catalog would have
served, where a contract with one is the consumer saying which number it is
relying on.

**It is not Pact, and the mechanism was a decision rather than a
convenience** — [ADR-023](appendix-a-adrs.md#adr-023--the-consumer-driven-contract-is-a-linked-file-not-pact)
records it. Pact's .NET binding cannot express gRPC at all, which is the only
relationship here that needed one; what Pact is *for* — one artefact the
consumer authors and the provider verifies — is taken, and the broker and wire
format that ship it across a repository boundary are declined, because this is a
monorepo and that boundary is not there.

**Two things it does not do.** It covers one relationship, because the platform
has one synchronous hop; a second would be the same conditional judgement again
rather than an automatic second contract. And it does not cross a repository
boundary — extract the BFF and this file becomes something that has to be
published, at which point Pact is the answer after all.

## 12.7 Test doubles

| Dependency | Approach |
|---|---|
| Domain objects | None. Use real ones. |
| Own database | Real, via Testcontainers |
| Own Redis | Real, via Testcontainers |
| Own broker | Real container, or the MassTransit test harness |
| Another service (HTTP) | WireMock.Net — a real HTTP server with stubbed responses |
| Third-party API | WireMock.Net, plus a nightly contract test against their sandbox |
| Clock | `FakeTimeProvider` from `Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing` |
| Random / GUIDs | Inject a seam; never call `Guid.NewGuid()` where the value is asserted |

**Mock only what you do not own.** Mocking your own repository tests your
understanding of the mock rather than the behaviour of the system, and it is the
single most common cause of a green suite over a broken application.

## 12.8 Conventions

- **Naming:** `Method_expected_behaviour_when_condition`. Readable in the
  test-runner output without opening the file.
- **One logical assertion per test.** Several `Should` calls verifying one
  outcome is fine; testing two unrelated behaviours is not.
- **No conditionals in tests.** An `if` in a test means it is two tests.
- **No shared mutable state between tests.** Every test constructs what it needs.
- **Deterministic.** No `DateTime.Now`, no unseeded random, no reliance on
  execution order, no `Thread.Sleep` — wait on a condition instead.
- **Every consumer and projection gets a redelivery test.** Not a convention —
  a test, because the guarantee it protects is invisible in the code that
  breaks it. The inbox commits separately from a Dapper projection's write
  (§9.5), so a crash between them redelivers, and idempotency is what makes
  that harmless. The test is one line longer than the happy path: handle the
  same event twice, assert the row and every counter read the same as after
  one. A new handler that skips it fails the first time production restarts
  at the wrong moment, which is to say months later, on data nobody can
  reconstruct.

## 12.9 What not to test

Auto-properties. Framework behaviour. Third-party libraries. EF Core's mapping
in a unit test — it is covered by any integration test that reads and writes.
Private methods — test them through the public API that uses them, or extract
them into something with its own public API.

**Coverage** is a diagnostic, not a target. Below roughly 60% you are certainly
missing things worth testing; above roughly 85% you are usually testing getters
to move a number. Watch the *trend* and watch coverage of the domain layer
specifically — that is where it should be near-total, and where it is cheapest
to achieve.

That last sentence is an instruction until something measures it, so
`coverage.runsettings` does:

```bash
dotnet test Platform.slnx --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~ArchitectureTests" \
    --collect:"Code Coverage" --settings coverage.runsettings \
    --results-directory ./TestResults
```

**Both flags after the settings file are load-bearing.** Without
`--results-directory` the collector writes under each test project's own
`TestResults/` rather than the repo root, so the reporter finds nothing; the
filter is what keeps §4.2's gates out of the instrumented run, for the reason
the callout below gives. `docs/testing.md` carries the reporting command that
follows it.

The file filters the report to `.*\.Domain\.dll$` and emits Cobertura, and CI
prints the figure to the job summary. **Reported, never gated** — a diagnostic
wired to a build failure stops being read and starts being satisfied.

**PR-25 took that decision rather than deferring it, and this passage used to
defer.** It read "a threshold that fails a build is PR-25's quality gates",
which named the pull request entitled to add one; that pull request declined,
on the sentence above rather than on effort. What it gated instead is whether
each stage *ran* — a fact, where a coverage percentage is a target — and
[Appendix C](appendix-c-delivery-plan.md)'s "quality gates" is that. A later
change may still argue for a threshold; it will be arguing against this
paragraph rather than filling a gap it left open.

**The figure is now a union across stages, and that is forced rather than
chosen.** §15.1 runs the unit and integration halves as separate `dotnet test`
invocations, so there is no longer one run to read — and the sentence above
asks for the domain assemblies "over the whole run". Measured on this
repository: the unit stage covers 253 of 308 method lines and the integration
stage 192, and the union is **257**. Four of those lines are reached only by a
test that needs a container, so a figure taken from either half alone
under-reports the thing it is named after.

Three things about that filter are deliberate:

- **It is a pattern, not a list.** `Catalog.Domain`, `Ordering.Domain` and
  `Common.Domain` match it today, and every later service's Domain matches it
  the day it exists. A list would have to be edited by whoever adds a service,
  which is exactly the edit that gets missed.
- **It measures the domain assemblies over the whole run**, not the domain test
  projects. Domain types are exercised by application and API tests too, and a
  figure taken from `*.Domain.Tests` alone would under-report the thing it is
  named after.
- **The collector arrives with `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`**, so no package was
  added and [Appendix B](appendix-b-licences.md) gained no entry. A coverage
  figure is not worth a new dependency.

`docs/testing.md` carries the commands, the categories and what needs Docker —
the operational half of this chapter, kept separate because a runner flag goes
stale on a different clock than a strategy does. Where the two disagree, this
chapter wins.
