# Appendix A — Architecture decision records

Short-form ADRs. Each records what was decided, why, and what it costs. The
value is in the "consequences" column — that is what a future reader needs when
the decision looks wrong.

## ADR-001 — Database per service

**Decision.** Each service owns a SQL Server database. No shared tables, no
cross-database queries.
**Why.** A shared database couples deployment, schema evolution and scaling.
Any change to a shared table requires coordinating every service that reads it,
which reintroduces the constraint microservices exist to remove.
**Consequences.** No cross-service joins or foreign keys. Some data is
duplicated. Reporting needs a separate approach — read replicas or a warehouse
fed by events.

## ADR-002 — Async messaging as the default

**Decision.** Services integrate through events on RabbitMQ. Synchronous calls
are the exception and require an explicit justification.
**Why.** Chained synchronous calls multiply latency and failure probability; a
service that is temporarily down should queue work, not fail requests.
**Consequences.** Eventual consistency everywhere. Debugging requires
distributed tracing. UIs must handle "in progress" states.

## ADR-003 — MassTransit v8, pinned

**Decision.** Use MassTransit 8.x (Apache 2.0) and pin the major version.
**Why.** MassTransit v9 moved to a commercial licence in 2026 at $400–1,200 per
month. v8 remains Apache 2.0 and maintained into 2026, and its abstraction over
RabbitMQ keeps the broker replaceable.
**Consequences.** A migration decision is required when v8 maintenance ends.
Options: pay for v9, move to Wolverine, adopt a community fork, or use
`RabbitMQ.Client` directly. What preserves all four is that **no Application or
Domain code touches a MassTransit type**: publication goes through
`IIntegrationEventPublisher` ([§9.3](09-messaging.md)) and the only MassTransit surface is the
outbox dispatcher, the consumer classes and the bus configuration — all in
Infrastructure. Note that `IPublishEndpoint` and `IBus` are MassTransit types
and so are *not* the abstraction; using them as the seam would mean abstracting
MassTransit behind MassTransit.
**Review by.** Q4 2026.

## ADR-004 — No mediator library

**Decision.** Implement the command/query dispatcher and pipeline in
`Common.Application` — roughly 80 lines.
**Why.** MediatR moved to a commercial licence. The functionality used here is
small, and owning it removes a dependency, a licence obligation, and a layer of
reflection that obscures stack traces.
**Consequences.** A small amount of infrastructure code to maintain and test.
New developers cannot rely on MediatR familiarity, so the dispatcher needs to
stay simple and documented.

## ADR-005 — EF Core for writes, Dapper for reads

**Decision.** Aggregates persist through EF Core; queries use Dapper.
**Why.** EF Core's change tracking and rich mapping suit aggregate persistence.
For reads it adds overhead and invites accidental N+1 and over-fetching. Dapper
gives exact control over the SQL for the shapes the API returns.
**Consequences.** Two data access technologies. SQL in query handlers must be
maintained by hand when the schema changes — integration tests catch this.

## ADR-006 — Redis for cache and coordination, never as a store of record

**Decision.** Redis holds cached read models, idempotency keys, distributed
locks and the token denylist. Nothing that must survive its loss. These are
split across **two instances with different eviction policies**: a cache
instance under `allkeys-lru`, and a coordination instance under `noeviction`
for locks, idempotency keys and the denylist. Shared rate-limit counters belong
on the coordination instance when they are built; the gateway's v1 limiter is
in-process and per-replica, and [§10.3](10-api-gateway.md) states what that costs.
**Why.** Redis is fast and its durability guarantees are weaker than SQL
Server's. Treating it as authoritative for anything means accepting data loss.
The split exists because eviction policy is a property of the whole keyspace:
an `allkeys-lru` instance under memory pressure will evict a held lock or a
revoked-token entry with no error and no log line ([§8.1](08-caching-redis.md)).
**Consequences.** Two Redis instances to run, two connection strings, and a
keyed-service registration so choosing the wrong one is a visible decision.
Every cached value must be reconstructible from SQL Server. A cold cache causes
a load spike on the databases, which capacity planning must allow for; a lost
coordination instance is more serious and is why it runs with persistence
enabled.

## ADR-007 — Migrations as a pre-deploy job

**Decision.** Never call `Database.Migrate()` at application startup.
**Why.** Multiple replicas race; rolling deploys run old code against a new
schema; and the runtime identity would need DDL permissions.
**Consequences.** Every migration must be backward compatible with the running
version. Destructive changes become multi-release sequences.

## ADR-008 — YARP as the gateway

**Decision.** YARP, self-hosted, with routing/auth/rate-limiting only.
**Why.** MIT, actively maintained by Microsoft, configurable in code as well as
JSON, and it runs in the same stack the team already knows. Ocelot is
comparatively quiet; managed gateways add cloud coupling and cost.
**Consequences.** The gateway is a service to operate and scale. Its config must
stay disciplined — aggregation belongs in a BFF, not here.

## ADR-009 — Keycloak, not a hand-built identity service

**Decision.** Keycloak (Apache 2.0) as the OIDC provider.
**Why.** Authentication is a solved problem with a long tail of security detail
and no business differentiation. Building it creates liability and no value.
**Consequences.** Keycloak is another component to run, upgrade and back up.
Realm configuration must be source-controlled and imported, not clicked through
the admin UI.

## ADR-010 — Testcontainers, not in-memory providers

**Decision.** Integration tests run against real SQL Server, Redis and RabbitMQ
in containers.
**Why.** The EF Core in-memory provider does not enforce foreign keys, does not
implement `rowversion` concurrency, and translates LINQ differently. Tests green
against it still fail in production.
**Consequences.** Tests need a Docker daemon and take seconds rather than
milliseconds. Mitigated by sharing containers per collection and resetting with
Respawn.

## ADR-011 — Compose baseline, Aspire optional

**Decision.** Docker Compose is the documented local development environment.
Aspire is offered as an optional accelerator.
**Why.** Compose is universal, stable and language-agnostic, which suits a
reference architecture. Aspire gives a materially better inner loop and free
distributed tracing, but adds a fast-moving dependency and a visible tooling
opinion.
**Consequences.** Two local-dev paths to document and keep working. Mitigated by
Aspire's ability to emit a Compose file from the same model, and by the low exit
cost (section 14.2).

## ADR-012 — Contracts versioned by namespace

**Decision.** Integration events live in `Common.Contracts.<Service>.V<n>`.
Breaking changes create a new version; both are published during a deprecation
window.
**Why.** It is the only mechanism that lets producers and consumers deploy
independently, which is the entire point of the architecture.
**Consequences.** Contract changes require deliberate planning. Consumer
adoption must be tracked with telemetry before a version is retired.

## ADR-013 — Dapr not adopted

**Decision.** No Dapr sidecars. Messaging is MassTransit over RabbitMQ; state is
EF Core over SQL Server; secrets come from the platform's secret store.
**Why.** Dapr's building blocks are genuinely useful in polyglot estates. In an
all-.NET platform they add a sidecar per pod, a control plane to operate, and an
abstraction over a broker the team already programs directly. Its state store
abstraction is the specific concern: it makes "any service can read any state"
mechanically easy, which erodes the data ownership rule this architecture is
built on.
**Consequences.** No portability across message brokers beyond what MassTransit
provides, and no free service invocation with mTLS. Revisit if services in other
languages become first-class.

## ADR-014 — Wolverine not adopted, but kept as the exit

**Decision.** MassTransit for messaging, a hand-rolled dispatcher for in-process
CQRS.
**Why.** Wolverine is a credible single-stack alternative covering both, with a
strong transactional inbox/outbox story. It is not adopted because it couples
the CQRS choice to the messaging choice — replacing one would mean replacing
both.
**Consequences.** Wolverine remains the most likely destination if MassTransit
v8 maintenance ends and v9's licence is declined (ADR-003). Confining every
MassTransit type to Infrastructure — behind `IIntegrationEventPublisher` on the
publish side and thin consumer adapters on the receive side — is what keeps that
migration a bounded piece of work rather than a rewrite. Switching is an
ADR-level decision, not a silent swap.

## ADR-015 — Minimal APIs, not MVC controllers

**Decision.** Endpoints are Minimal API groups.
**Why.** The endpoint layer translates HTTP to a command or query and does
nothing else. Controllers bring a base class, action filters and binding
conventions to do that, and the filter pipeline duplicates the dispatcher
pipeline.
**Consequences.** Endpoint classes must be organised deliberately — a single
`Program.cs` of two hundred `MapPost` calls is worse than controllers were. One
static class of extension methods per aggregate, registered from the composition
root.

## ADR-016 — Cursor pagination by default

**Decision.** Collection endpoints use opaque keyset cursors. `page`/`pageSize`
is not the default.
**Why.** `OFFSET n ROWS` costs proportionally to `n`, and results shift under
concurrent inserts, so a user paging through a live list sees duplicates and
skips.
**Consequences.** No "jump to page 47" and no cheap total count. Where a UI
genuinely needs either — an admin table over a bounded set — offset pagination
is an explicit, documented exception.

## ADR-017 — One synchronous hop

**Decision.** At most one synchronous downstream service call per inbound
request. Synchronous calls inside message consumers require a written exception.
**Why.** Availability multiplies and latency accumulates down a chain. Four
services at 99.9% give 99.6% — 43 minutes of monthly downtime becomes nearly
three hours with no service having missed its own target.
**Consequences.** Cross-context data must arrive by event and be projected
locally, which means designing for staleness in the UI. That is the intended
trade.

## ADR-018 — Reactions happen after commit

**Decision.** Nothing subscribes to a domain event inside the write
transaction. The dispatcher stages outbox rows and performs no other I/O;
projections, cache invalidation and integration publishing all run afterwards,
driven by the outbox ([§7.5](07-persistence.md)).
**Why.** An in-process handler on its own connection is a second transaction
that can commit while the aggregate rolls back. One sharing the `DbContext` is
atomic but not retryable, so a read-model bug becomes a write-path outage.
Either version deadlocks against the locks the outer transaction still holds,
under load and not under test.
**Consequences.** Read models are eventually consistent by construction, and
the lag is visible rather than pretended away. The outbox grows a second
delivery lane (`Local`) so same-service reactions get the same durability and
retry accounting as cross-service ones. A projection can be fixed and replayed
without touching the write path — which is the property that pays for the
staleness.
