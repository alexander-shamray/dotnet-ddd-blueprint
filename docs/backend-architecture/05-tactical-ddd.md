# 5. Tactical DDD

## 5.1 The building blocks

| Block | Definition | Test |
|---|---|---|
| **Entity** | Has identity that persists through change. | Two instances with the same ID are the same thing regardless of other fields. |
| **Value object** | Defined entirely by its values; immutable. | Two instances with equal values are interchangeable. |
| **Aggregate** | A cluster of entities and value objects with one root, forming a consistency boundary. | Can you state an invariant that must hold across all of it, atomically? |
| **Aggregate root** | The only entity outside code may hold a reference to. | Every path into the aggregate goes through it. |
| **Domain event** | A record that something meaningful happened, in past tense. | A domain expert would recognise the name. |
| **Repository** | Collection-like access to aggregate roots. One per aggregate. | It loads and saves whole aggregates, never fragments. |
| **Domain service** | Logic that belongs to no single aggregate. | It genuinely spans aggregates or needs external data. Rare — be suspicious. |

## 5.2 Strongly typed identifiers

Primitive `Guid` identifiers allow `GetOrder(customerId)` to compile. Typed IDs
make that a compile error, which over the lifetime of a system prevents a
recurring class of bug at essentially zero cost.

```csharp
namespace Ordering.Domain.Orders;

public readonly record struct OrderId(Guid Value)
{
    // Version 7 rather than 4: the leading 48 bits are a millisecond
    // timestamp, so every identifier carries when it was made. Read the trap
    // below before assuming that also makes it a sequential key.
    public static OrderId New() => new(Guid.CreateVersion7());

    public override string ToString() => Value.ToString();
}
```

> **Trap — a time-ordered Guid is not a sequential key in SQL Server.** UUIDv7
> puts its timestamp in the **first** six bytes. `uniqueidentifier` compares the
> **last** six first and works backwards from there, so it never reaches the
> timestamp until every random byte has already decided the order. Version 7
> values therefore arrive in a clustered index as scattered as version 4 ones,
> and the page splits the version was reached for happen anyway.
>
> This is the shape the blueprint deploys, not a hypothetical:
> `HasKey(o => o.Id)` ([§7.2](07-persistence.md)) leaves SQL Server to make
> that primary key clustered, which it does by default.
>
> What version 7 actually buys is a creation time readable inside every
> identifier, which earns its place for support and forensics on its own. If
> insert locality ever becomes the binding constraint, the fix is a physical
> one — a different column type, or a clustered key that is not the identifier
> — and it belongs in §7 with the rest of the storage shape rather than here.

## 5.3 Value objects

```csharp
namespace Ordering.Domain.Common;

public readonly record struct Money
{
    public decimal Amount { get; }
    public string Currency { get; }

    private Money(decimal amount, string currency)
    {
        Amount = amount;
        Currency = currency;
    }

    public static Money Of(decimal amount, string currency)
    {
        if (amount < 0)
            throw new DomainException("Money cannot be negative.");

        // Letters as well as length: "1$?" is three characters and no
        // currency, and a guard that admits it makes the exception message a
        // stricter claim than the type keeps.
        if (currency is not { Length: 3 } || !currency.All(char.IsAsciiLetter))
            throw new DomainException("Currency must be a 3-letter currency code.");

        return new Money(decimal.Round(amount, 2, MidpointRounding.ToEven), currency.ToUpperInvariant());
    }

    public static Money Zero(string currency) => Of(0m, currency);

    public static Money operator +(Money left, Money right)
    {
        EnsureSameCurrency(left, right);
        return new Money(left.Amount + right.Amount, left.Currency);
    }

    public static Money operator *(Money money, int quantity)
    {
        // Without this guard the operator is a back door past Of: a negative
        // quantity would construct the negative Money the factory refuses.
        if (quantity < 0)
            throw new DomainException("Money cannot be multiplied by a negative quantity.");

        return new Money(money.Amount * quantity, money.Currency);
    }

    private static void EnsureSameCurrency(Money left, Money right)
    {
        if (left.Currency != right.Currency)
        {
            throw new DomainException(
                $"Cannot combine {left.Currency} with {right.Currency}.");
        }
    }
}
```

The constructor is private and `Of` is the only way in. An invalid `Money`
cannot be constructed, so no code downstream needs to check for one. This is the
**always-valid** principle, and applying it consistently removes a surprising
amount of defensive code from the rest of the system.

## 5.4 An aggregate

`Order` is the core aggregate of the blueprint. Note what it does *not* have:
public setters, a parameterless public constructor, references to other
aggregates by object, or any knowledge of persistence.

```csharp
namespace Ordering.Domain.Orders;

public sealed class Order : AggregateRoot<OrderId>
{
    private readonly List<OrderLine> _lines = [];

    public CustomerId CustomerId { get; private set; }
    public OrderStatus Status { get; private set; }
    public Address ShippingAddress { get; private set; }
    public DateTimeOffset PlacedAt { get; private set; }
    public IReadOnlyList<OrderLine> Lines => _lines.AsReadOnly();

    public Money Total => _lines.Aggregate(Money.Zero(_currency), (sum, line) => sum + line.LineTotal);

    /// <summary>
    /// An immutable copy of the lines, for events. `Lines` returns a read-only
    /// *view* over the live list, so an event holding it would keep changing
    /// after the fact — a record of what happened must not track what happens
    /// next.
    /// </summary>
    private IReadOnlyList<OrderLineSnapshot> SnapshotLines() =>
        [.. _lines.Select(l => new OrderLineSnapshot(l.ProductId, l.Quantity, l.UnitPrice))];

    private readonly string _currency;

    // EF Core materialisation only.
    private Order() { }

    private Order(OrderId id, CustomerId customerId, Address shippingAddress, string currency, DateTimeOffset placedAt)
    {
        Id = id;
        CustomerId = customerId;
        ShippingAddress = shippingAddress;
        _currency = currency;
        PlacedAt = placedAt;
        Status = OrderStatus.Draft;
    }

    public static Order Place(
        CustomerId customerId,
        Address shippingAddress,
        IEnumerable<(ProductId Product, int Quantity, Money UnitPrice)> items,
        string currency,
        DateTimeOffset now)
    {
        // Of rather than a bare assignment: the order's currency is what every
        // line is checked against, so an unvalidated one makes AddLine's
        // comparison meaningless and Money.Zero(_currency) throw later, far
        // from the call that caused it. The validator refuses a malformed code
        // at the edge; the aggregate does not depend on having been called
        // through one.
        string normalised = Money.Zero(currency).Currency;

        var order = new Order(OrderId.New(), customerId, shippingAddress, normalised, now);

        foreach (var (product, quantity, unitPrice) in items)
            order.AddLine(product, quantity, unitPrice);

        if (order._lines.Count == 0)
            throw new DomainException("An order must contain at least one line.");

        order.Status = OrderStatus.AwaitingStock;
        // Lines travel with the event: the integration contract needs them so
        // Inventory can reserve stock (§9.6), and a handler must not have to
        // reload the aggregate to find out what was ordered.
        order.Raise(
            new OrderPlacedDomainEvent(order.Id, customerId, order.Total, order.SnapshotLines(), now));

        return order;
    }

    private void AddLine(ProductId product, int quantity, Money unitPrice)
    {
        if (quantity <= 0)
            throw new DomainException("Quantity must be positive.");
        if (unitPrice.Currency != _currency)
            throw new DomainException("All lines must share the order currency.");

        OrderLine? existing = _lines.SingleOrDefault(l => l.ProductId == product);
        if (existing is not null)
        {
            // The merge keeps the price already held, so a second line at a
            // different one would silently reprice the first line's quantity
            // as well — a Total no consumer could derive from the request.
            if (existing.UnitPrice != unitPrice)
                throw new DomainException("A product cannot appear twice at different prices.");

            existing.IncreaseQuantity(quantity);
        }
        else
        {
            _lines.Add(OrderLine.For(product, quantity, unitPrice));
        }
    }

    public void ConfirmStock(DateTimeOffset now)
    {
        EnsureStatus(OrderStatus.AwaitingStock);
        Status = OrderStatus.AwaitingPayment;
        Raise(new OrderStockConfirmedDomainEvent(Id, Total, now));
    }

    public void ConfirmPayment(PaymentReference reference, DateTimeOffset now)
    {
        EnsureStatus(OrderStatus.AwaitingPayment);
        Status = OrderStatus.Confirmed;
        // Total and Lines are required by the V1.OrderConfirmed contract (§9.1);
        // the mapper has only the event to work from.
        Raise(
            new OrderConfirmedDomainEvent(Id, CustomerId, reference, ShippingAddress, Total, SnapshotLines(), now));
    }

    public void MarkShipped(TrackingNumber tracking, DateTimeOffset now)
    {
        EnsureStatus(OrderStatus.Confirmed);
        Status = OrderStatus.Shipped;
        Raise(new OrderShippedDomainEvent(Id, CustomerId, tracking, now));
    }

    // Origin is recorded, never checked: no invariant here turns on who
    // asked, and §11.4 has already decided whether this caller may. It
    // travels because §9.6's saga has to tell its own echo from a
    // cancellation somebody else caused, and Reason cannot answer that.
    public void Cancel(CancellationReason reason, CancellationOrigin origin, DateTimeOffset now)
    {
        if (Status is OrderStatus.Shipped or OrderStatus.Delivered)
        {
            throw new DomainException(
                $"A {Status} order cannot be cancelled; raise a return instead.");
        }
        if (Status is OrderStatus.Cancelled)
            return;   // Idempotent — cancelling twice is not an error.

        Status = OrderStatus.Cancelled;
        Raise(new OrderCancelledDomainEvent(Id, CustomerId, reason, origin, now));
    }

    private void EnsureStatus(OrderStatus expected)
    {
        if (Status != expected)
        {
            throw new DomainException(
                $"Expected order to be {expected} but it is {Status}.");
        }
    }
}
```

Points worth noticing:

- **`Place` is a factory, not a constructor.** It names the business operation
  and can enforce rules a constructor cannot express cleanly.
- **`_lines` is private; `Lines` is read-only.** Callers cannot bypass `AddLine`
  and its invariants.
- **`Cancel` is idempotent.** Because events arrive at-least-once, aggregate
  methods driven by events should tolerate repetition.
- **`now` is a parameter.** The domain never reads the clock. This makes every
  time-dependent rule trivially testable without freezing time globally.
- **Other aggregates are referenced by ID**, never by object. `CustomerId`, not
  `Customer`. This is what keeps the aggregate loadable in one query and the
  transaction boundary honest.

## 5.5 Domain events

```csharp
public interface IDomainEvent
{
    DateTimeOffset OccurredAt { get; }
}

/// <summary>
/// Non-generic markers. Infrastructure filters EF's change tracker by them —
/// `Entries<IHasDomainEvents>()` in §7.5, `is IAggregateRoot` in §6.3 — and the
/// tracker holds objects, not `AggregateRoot<TId>` for a known TId. Without a
/// non-generic interface to test against, those queries would need to know
/// every key type in the model.
/// </summary>
public interface IHasDomainEvents
{
    IReadOnlyList<IDomainEvent> DomainEvents { get; }
    void ClearDomainEvents();
}

public interface IAggregateRoot;

/// <summary>
/// §5.1's first row, made executable: identity persists through change, so two
/// entities of the same type with the same Id are the same thing however much
/// else differs between them.
/// </summary>
public abstract class Entity<TId> : IEquatable<Entity<TId>>
    where TId : struct
{
    // Assigned by whatever creates the entity — a factory after the base
    // constructor has run, or EF Core materialising through a private
    // parameterless one (§5.4). Hence a protected setter rather than `init`.
    public TId Id { get; protected set; }

    // Type as well as identifier. A comparison that comes down to the Id alone
    // makes an OrderLine equal to the Order it belongs to the moment the two
    // share a key type, and nothing about that reads as wrong at the call site.
    public bool Equals(Entity<TId>? other) =>
        other is not null &&
        GetType() == other.GetType() &&
        EqualityComparer<TId>.Default.Equals(Id, other.Id);

    public override bool Equals(object? obj) => Equals(obj as Entity<TId>);

    public override int GetHashCode() => HashCode.Combine(GetType(), Id);

    // Declared, not inherited. Without these two, `==` goes on comparing
    // references while `Equals` compares identifiers — the same pair equal by
    // one operator and not the other, in a language where both read the same.
    public static bool operator ==(Entity<TId>? left, Entity<TId>? right) =>
        left is null ? right is null : left.Equals(right);

    public static bool operator !=(Entity<TId>? left, Entity<TId>? right) => !(left == right);
}

public abstract class AggregateRoot<TId>
    : Entity<TId>, IAggregateRoot, IHasDomainEvents
    where TId : struct
{
    private readonly List<IDomainEvent> _domainEvents = [];

    public IReadOnlyList<IDomainEvent> DomainEvents => _domainEvents.AsReadOnly();

    protected void Raise(IDomainEvent domainEvent) => _domainEvents.Add(domainEvent);

    public void ClearDomainEvents() => _domainEvents.Clear();

    // Optimistic concurrency token, mapped to SQL Server rowversion.
    public byte[] Version { get; private set; } = [];
}
```

The events themselves are records in the Domain project, free to carry domain
types — that freedom is the point of keeping them separate from contracts:

```csharp
namespace Ordering.Domain.Orders.Events;

/// <summary>Immutable copy of a line as it stood when the event was raised.</summary>
public sealed record OrderLineSnapshot(ProductId ProductId, int Quantity, Money UnitPrice);

public sealed record OrderPlacedDomainEvent(
    OrderId OrderId,
    CustomerId CustomerId,
    Money Total,
    IReadOnlyList<OrderLineSnapshot> Lines,
    DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;

public sealed record OrderConfirmedDomainEvent(
    OrderId OrderId,
    CustomerId CustomerId,
    PaymentReference Reference,
    Address ShippingAddress,
    Money Total,
    IReadOnlyList<OrderLineSnapshot> Lines,
    DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;

public sealed record OrderStockConfirmedDomainEvent(
    OrderId OrderId,
    Money Total,
    DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;

public sealed record OrderShippedDomainEvent(
    OrderId OrderId,
    CustomerId CustomerId,
    TrackingNumber Tracking,
    DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;

public sealed record OrderCancelledDomainEvent(
    OrderId OrderId,
    CustomerId CustomerId,
    CancellationReason Reason,
    CancellationOrigin Origin,
    DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : IDomainEvent;
```

All five name the identifier `OrderId`, not `Id`. The projection in §6.6 reads
`e.OrderId` across every handler, so one record calling it something else would
break only that handler — the kind of divergence a positional `Raise(Id, …)`
call site hides completely.

Two rules these illustrate:

**Carry everything the contract needs.** `OrderConfirmedDomainEvent` holds
`Total` and `Lines` it makes no domain use of, because `V1.OrderConfirmed`
requires them and the mapper ([§9.3](09-messaging.md)) sees only the event. An event missing a
field its contract declares is a mapper that cannot be written.

**Snapshot, never alias.** `OrderLineSnapshot` exists because `Order.Lines` is a
read-only *view* over a live list of mutable entities. An event holding that
view would report whatever the aggregate looks like later, not what happened
when it was raised.

`Money`, `OrderId` and `ProductId` here would be forbidden in an integration
event (§9.1) — the mapper is where they are flattened to primitives.

Events accumulate on the aggregate. Raising one does not publish it, and the
two halves of what happens next are worth keeping apart, because [§7.5](07-persistence.md) is
normative about both and one of them is easy to state backwards:
`DomainEventDispatcher` runs **inside** the transaction, before `SaveChanges`,
and only **stages** outbox rows — it invokes no handler. Everything that
*reacts* runs after commit, driven by the outbox (ADR-018). "Dispatched" is the
staging; delivery is the dispatcher's job later.

**Domain events and integration events are different things** and conflating
them is one of the most consequential mistakes in this architecture:

| | Domain event | Integration event |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Inside one service | Across services |
| Coupling | Free to change with the code | A published contract, versioned |
| Content | Rich domain types | Primitives and simple DTOs only |
| Delivery | In-process after commit, via the outbox's `Local` lane (§7.5) | Message broker, via the outbox's `Broker` lane |
| Naming | `*DomainEvent` suffix | Bare name, in a versioned namespace (§9.2) |
| Example | `OrderConfirmedDomainEvent` | `Common.Contracts.Ordering.V1.OrderConfirmed` |

A domain event may be translated into an integration event. Never publish a
domain event directly onto the bus — it exposes your internal model as a public
contract and you will not be able to refactor afterwards.

**They must not share a type name.** `OrderPlacedDomainEvent` and
`Common.Contracts.Ordering.V1.OrderPlaced` describe the same business fact in
two shapes — one carries `Money`, the other a `decimal` and a currency code —
and a single name for both makes the mapper in §9.3 read as an identity
function. Namespace versioning (ADR-012) distinguishes contract *versions*, not
contracts from domain events; the suffix does that.

## 5.6 Repositories

Defined in Domain, implemented in Infrastructure. One per aggregate root.

```csharp
namespace Ordering.Domain.Orders;

public interface IOrderRepository
{
    Task<Order?> GetAsync(OrderId id, CancellationToken ct);
    Task<Order?> GetByPaymentReferenceAsync(PaymentReference reference, CancellationToken ct);
    void Add(Order order);
}
```

There is no `Update` — the unit of work tracks changes — and no `GetAll`,
`Find(Expression<...>)` or `IQueryable`. A repository that returns `IQueryable`
lets callers build arbitrary queries against the domain model, which leaks
persistence concerns everywhere and makes the aggregate boundary unenforceable.

**Reads do not go through repositories.** Query handlers use Dapper directly
against read models (section 6.5). Repositories exist only to load aggregates
for the purpose of changing them.

## 5.7 Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Anaemic domain model — entities of public setters, logic in services | The model enforces nothing; invariants scatter and drift | Behaviour on the aggregate; setters private |
| Aggregate referencing another aggregate by object | Loads half the database; transaction spans two consistency boundaries | Reference by typed ID |
| Huge aggregate (`Customer` owning all orders) | Every write locks everything; concurrency collapses | Split by invariant, not by "belongs to" |
| Repository per entity | Lets callers modify children outside the root | Repository per aggregate root only |
| Injecting `IEmailSender` into an aggregate | Domain now depends on infrastructure and cannot be unit tested | Raise a domain event; handle it outside |
| `DateTime.UtcNow` inside the domain | Non-deterministic tests, hidden dependency | Pass time in as a parameter |
| Domain exceptions used for validation of user input | Exceptions for control flow; poor error messages | Validate in the application layer; domain exceptions signal bugs |
