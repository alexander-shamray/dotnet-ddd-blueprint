# Runbook — abandoned outbox rows

| Signal | `OutboxMetrics`, `Ordering.Infrastructure/Observability` ([§13.6](../backend-architecture/13-observability.md)) |

## What it means

**Permanent data loss.** A message has exceeded §9.4's attempt cap of ten, so
the dispatcher's claim — `WHERE Attempts < @MaxAttempts` — skips it for ever.
Nothing will retry it.

**What it does *not* look like here is a green graph**, and that is worth
knowing before you go looking for one. §13.6 warns that permanent loss can look
identical to a healthy empty backlog; **this platform's gauges are built so it
does not.** `PendingCount` and `OldestAgeSeconds` both count every unprocessed
row, abandoned ones included, so an abandoned row keeps the backlog non-zero and
pins the age gauge — indefinitely.

So the failure mode here is the *other* one: an abandoned row looks exactly like
an ordinary stall on every other panel, and you would work
[`outbox-broker.md`](outbox-broker.md) or
[`projection-lag.md`](projection-lag.md) for ever without fixing it. **That is
what this gauge is for** — it separates a row nothing will retry from one that
is merely waiting.

This is also why the alert has no `for` clause. Every other rule waits out a
transient; an abandoned row is already permanent by the time it is counted, so
waiting only delays the page.

## The lane says whose loss it is

Read the label before anything else, because the blast radius and the recovery
are different:

- **`Broker`** — other services never learned something. The event is gone from
  their world. Whatever they would have done on receipt has not happened, and
  will not, until this row is delivered or the effect is produced another way.
- **`Local`** — this service's own read model is permanently wrong. Users are
  looking at a listing that is missing a row and will stay missing.

```promql
max by (service_name, lane) (outbox_abandoned_count)
```

**`max`, never `sum`.** The gauge reads the database, so every replica of the
service exports the same number — Ordering's chart runs three. Summing reports
three times the real count, and the alerts, dashboards and this file all
deduplicate the same way.

## Read the rows before touching them

```sql
SELECT
    Id,
    MessageId,
    CorrelationId,
    MessageType,
    Lane,
    Attempts,
    OccurredAt,
    LastError = LEFT(LastError, 2000)
FROM ordering.OutboxMessages
WHERE ProcessedAt IS NULL
    AND Attempts >= 10
ORDER BY OccurredAt;
```

`LastError` is the first 2000 characters of the exception from the final
attempt, written by the dispatcher's fail statement. `CorrelationId` ties the
row back to the request that produced it, so the original trace and logs are
reachable ([§10.4](../backend-architecture/10-api-gateway.md), §13.4).

**`LastError` survives a replay**, so reading it is not a race. The dispatcher's
completion statement sets `ProcessedAt` and `LockedUntil` and touches nothing
else, and the replay below clears only `Attempts` and the lease — so the text of
the final failure stays on the row until retention deletes it. An earlier
version of this file warned that a successful redelivery would erase it; that
was wrong about the implementation, and knowing the record persists is what lets
you replay first and diagnose after.

## Deciding: repair, replay, or discard

Work out which of three things happened.

### The message is fine and the world was broken

A broker that was unreachable for longer than the backoff took to exhaust —
ten attempts with `POWER(2, min(Attempts, 8)) * 5` seconds between them is a
little over forty minutes to the cap. This is the commonest cause and the
easiest: the payload is valid, the destination is now up, and a replay is
correct.

### The message is malformed

A payload the consumer cannot deserialise, or a `MessageType` that no longer
maps. Replaying it will fail ten more times. Fix the mapping or the payload
first — and note that a payload edit is a hand-write into a table, so it wants a
second pair of eyes.

Check the type still resolves; §9.4's `MessageTypeMap` is what turns the column
into a CLR type, and `MessageTypeMapValidator` fails the host at startup on a
duplicate but says nothing about a name that has since been deleted.

### The effect already happened another way

Somebody compensated by hand during the incident. Then a replay would double
it — and whether that is harmless depends entirely on whether the consumer is
idempotent. §9.5's inbox filter makes *redelivery of the same `MessageId`*
safe, so a replay of this row is safe even if it partly succeeded before; a
manual action taken outside the system is not covered by it.

## Replaying

```sql
-- One row at a time. Named by MessageId, never by a bare predicate over the
-- whole abandoned set: the set may hold rows in all three categories above.
UPDATE ordering.OutboxMessages
SET
    Attempts    = 0,
    LockedUntil = NULL
WHERE MessageId = @MessageId
    AND ProcessedAt IS NULL;
```

The dispatcher picks it up on the next tick. Watch it rather than assuming:

```sql
SELECT
    MessageId,
    Attempts,
    ProcessedAt,
    LastError = LEFT(LastError, 500)
FROM ordering.OutboxMessages
WHERE MessageId = @MessageId;
```

A `ProcessedAt` that fills in is a delivery. An `Attempts` that starts climbing
again is the second category above, and stopping to fix the cause is cheaper
than watching it reach ten a second time.

## Discarding

Only when the effect is confirmed produced another way, and only with the
decision written down somewhere durable.

```sql
UPDATE ordering.OutboxMessages
SET ProcessedAt = SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()
WHERE MessageId = @MessageId
    AND ProcessedAt IS NULL;
```

Marking processed rather than deleting is deliberate: the row stays readable
until the retention purge removes it, so the decision remains auditable for the
retention window. **Never `DELETE`** — §9.4's purge predicate refuses to touch
unprocessed rows for exactly this reason, and a hand-written delete steps around
the one guard protecting them.

## Afterwards

An abandoned row means the retry policy did not fit the failure. Worth asking in
the postmortem: was forty minutes to the cap right for this dependency? The cap
lives once, as `OutboxDispatcher.MaxAttempts`, and §13.6's gauge reads that same
constant — so changing it moves the alert with it rather than leaving the two
disagreeing.
