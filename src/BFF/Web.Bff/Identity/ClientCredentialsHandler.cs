/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>It must sit inside the resilience pipeline</b>, which is what registering
/// it <i>after</i> <c>AddStandardResilienceHandler</c> does (§9.7). Outside it
/// the handler runs once per logical request rather than once per attempt, so
/// every retry replays the token the first attempt built.
/// <para>
/// What that buys is narrower than "a retry after a 401", which is how §11.5
/// used to put it and which its own configuration rules out — the standard
/// handler retries 5xx, 408 and <c>HttpRequestException</c>, and this hop's
/// callee answers gRPC statuses on an HTTP 200 besides. The real case is that
/// <i>whenever</i> a retry fires — a transport fault — the repeated attempt
/// asks <see cref="ITokenCache"/> again rather than replaying the first
/// attempt's token.
/// <para>
/// <b>Which usually returns the same token, and that is not a defect.</b>
/// <c>CachingTokenClient</c> serves a cached token until its expiry guard, so
/// the bytes are typically identical; what the position buys is that a token
/// which expired between attempts is refreshed for the next one. Narrower than
/// "carries a freshly fetched token", which is how this read until a review
/// checked it against the cache's own behaviour.
