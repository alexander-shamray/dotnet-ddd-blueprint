/// Written to be deleted. When that aggregate lands, re-anchor
/// <c>ArchitectureTests</c> in <c>Ordering.Domain.Tests</c> and
/// <c>Ordering.Application.Tests</c> on it and remove this file. A marker is
/// what a service has before it has a domain; leaving one in place after the
/// first aggregate arrives means the gates are judging an empty type instead
/// of the model they exist to constrain.
