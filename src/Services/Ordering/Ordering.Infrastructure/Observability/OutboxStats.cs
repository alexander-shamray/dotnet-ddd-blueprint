/// <b>It takes the connection factory rather than a scope, because that port is

/// <c>IServiceScopeFactory</c> on the stated grounds that this type must not
/// hold a <c>DbContext</c> — true, and satisfied here by never asking for one:
/// the reads are Dapper on a connection the caller disposes, which is what
/// §6.5 already says the read side is. The chapter was amended to match.
/// <para>
/// <b>Cached briefly, because the collector's schedule is not this type's to

/// every interval — and a metrics type that loads the database it is measuring
/// is a monitor that causes the symptom.

/// <b>Failure is an absent series, never a thrown exception.</b> A gauge
/// callback that throws is swallowed by the SDK and the measurement is simply
/// not exported, so nothing here tries to be clever about a database that is
/// down: readiness (§13.5) already covers that, and an outbox alert firing
/// because SQL Server is unreachable would page the wrong person with the
/// wrong runbook.
