/// <remarks>
/// <b>Public, not internal, for the same reason <c>Program</c> is (§4.2):</b>
/// the convention test that keeps this constructor honest names the type from
/// another assembly, and one access modifier is a smaller commitment than an
/// <c>InternalsVisibleTo</c> that has to name its consumer.
/// <para>
/// <b>The test for membership is not "is it a gauge" — it is "can this service
/// run for an hour without constructing it".</b> For every type below the
/// answer is yes. <see cref="RequestMetrics"/> is the worked example and the
/// one that nearly got left out: <c>LoggingBehavior</c> injects it and a
/// behaviour runs on every dispatched request, which is not the same as
/// something having constructed it — a health probe is mapped by
/// <c>MapHealthChecks</c> (§13.5) and never enters the pipeline, and a canary
/// before cutover or a service whose traffic has simply stopped publishes
/// nothing at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b><c>OrderMetrics</c> is absent because it does not exist yet, not because
/// it is exempt.</b> §13.3 puts it in <c>Ordering.Application</c> with
/// <c>OrderSummaryProjection</c> as its only call site, and §6.6's
/// <c>OrderSummaries</c> projection has not been built — PR-20 deferred it by
/// name. It joins this constructor in the PR that adds that projection, and
/// nobody has to remember: the convention test reads the container's
/// registrations rather than this list, so an unforced metrics type fails a
/// build the day it is registered.
