/// <summary>
/// §9.6's saga table. Mapped on this context deliberately: the saga repository
/// is configured with <c>ExistingDbContext&lt;OrderingDbContext&gt;()</c>, so
/// the instance lives in the service's own database and its migrations travel
/// with the service's.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Not for atomicity — the saga's effects reach other services as messages and
/// never share a transaction with them (ADR-002, §9.7). The reasons are
/// operational: one database per service to back up, one migration history, one
/// connection pool, and the saga table sits next to the orders it coordinates
/// when someone is debugging at 03:00.
/// <para>
/// <b>No <c>RowVersion</c>.</b> The repository runs
/// <c>ConcurrencyMode.Pessimistic</c>, which takes row locks rather than
/// comparing a version column — carrying one anyway would imply an optimistic
/// strategy the saga does not use.

        // column cannot go in the same release, because §15.5 requires every
        // migration to be backward compatible with the release still serving
        // beside it: migrations run ahead of the deploy, and the old build's
        // saga writes this column on every OrderPlaced.

        // A shadow property is what lets those two facts coexist. Nothing in

        // release on. The new build's INSERT does not name this column, so

        // materialises a non-nullable Guid from rows the new build wrote, so
        // the column must not be nullable and must not be absent. It reads

        // materialisation and a dropped one would fail the INSERT outright.
