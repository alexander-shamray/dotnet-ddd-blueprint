/// §6.4's local price projection — Catalog's prices, as Ordering last saw
/// them. Not an aggregate and not part of the domain model: a read model,
/// mapped here only so that <c>migrations add</c> emits its table.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>Mapped by EF, read by Dapper, and written by neither yet.</b>
/// <see cref="ProjectedPriceReader"/> queries it with Dapper (§6.5), and the
/// projection handler that maintains it is PR-20's. Configuring it through EF
/// is what makes the schema the migration's business rather than a hand-written
/// <c>CREATE TABLE</c> that would drift from the columns the reader selects.
/// <para>
/// There is no <c>DbSet</c> for it on the context, deliberately: nothing in
/// this service loads a price through EF, and a set would invite a write path
/// that bypasses the projection's idempotent <c>MERGE</c> (§6.6).
/// <c>ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly</c> finds this class regardless.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>UpdatedAt</c> is the out-of-order guard PR-20 needs — a projection
/// applying an older event after a newer one must be able to tell, and the
/// column has to exist before the handler that reads it. <b>The name is
/// §6.6's, not this file's choice</b>: it shipped as <c>LastSeenAt</c> and
/// PR-20 is specified to copy §6.6's <c>MERGE</c> verbatim, which would have
/// failed on a column that is not there. Naming a table the next PR writes is
/// exactly where a private preference costs somebody else a debugging session. <c>IsAvailable</c> is
/// the reader's filter: a product Catalog unpublishes stops being orderable
/// without its price row being deleted, so the history of what it cost
/// survives.
