/// <b>These are in-memory retries of one broker delivery, not redeliveries.</b>
/// <c>UseMessageRetry</c> holds the message and waits, so the delivery lock and
/// the endpoint's concurrency slot are still taken for the whole ladder — which
/// is what makes the ceiling an operational number rather than only a
/// correctness one. MassTransit's redelivery filters are a different API that
/// releases the message and has the broker deliver it again, and §9.5 uses the
/// word in that sense throughout.
/// <para>
/// Declaring the ladder once is what makes agreement between the endpoints
/// structural: an endpoint that wants a different one has to say so, where a
/// value repeated per endpoint can only be checked by reading every call site
/// and comparing them.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What this type does not decide is what gets retried.</b>
/// <c>ordering-commands</c> ignores <c>ContractMappingException</c> before
/// calling <see cref="Standard"/> — a malformed contract does not parse
/// itself on the fourth attempt — and that exclusion is the endpoint's,
/// because it is a claim about which faults are terminal rather than about
/// how long to wait between attempts. Folding it in here would apply one
/// endpoint's exclusion to those that never raise it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="RetryLimit"/> counts <em>retries</em> and not deliveries: the
/// endpoint makes one more attempt than this number, and the wait it produces
/// is that many intervals. §9.6's confirmation wait has to clear that sum —
/// a floor it must exceed rather than the term that decides it, which is
/// §9.4's dispatcher backoff — so the saga's own comment reasons about these
/// by name instead of restating them.
