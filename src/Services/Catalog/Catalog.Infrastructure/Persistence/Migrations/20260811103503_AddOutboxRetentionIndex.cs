/// <summary>
/// The index §9.4's retention purge deletes through, generated from
/// <see cref="OutboxMessageConfiguration"/> on <c>AddInbox</c>'s terms — the
/// configuration is the source of truth and only this file's dress is
/// hand-authored. The <c>.Designer.cs</c> and the snapshot beside it are
/// machine-owned and untouched.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>A second index rather than a wider first one, because the two predicates
/// are complements.</b> <c>IX_Outbox_Unprocessed</c> is filtered
/// <c>WHERE ProcessedAt IS NULL</c> for the claim, which excludes by
/// construction every row the purge's <c>ProcessedAt IS NOT NULL AND
/// ProcessedAt &lt; @Before</c> targets — so the purge had no usable index at
/// all and scanned the whole table, hourly, up to twenty times a pass. The
/// scan grew with the processed rows, which is to say it grew exactly as the
/// purge started to matter.
/// <para>
/// The inbox got its <c>IX_Inbox_HandledAt</c> when its purge was written and
/// this one did not, which is the asymmetry a review caught. Filtered the other
/// way for the same reason its twin is filtered: the purge never reads an
/// unprocessed row, so the index stays the size of the undeleted backlog rather
/// than of the table.
