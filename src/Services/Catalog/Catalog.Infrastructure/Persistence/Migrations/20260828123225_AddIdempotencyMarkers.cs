/// §8.5's idempotency markers, generated from
/// <see cref="IdempotencyMarkerConfiguration"/> on <c>AddInbox</c>'s terms —
/// the configuration is the source of truth and only this file's dress is
/// hand-authored (file-scoped namespace, this comment). The
/// <c>.Designer.cs</c> and the snapshot beside it are machine-owned and
/// untouched.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>This table is the one place in the schema where a missing row is a
/// correctness failure rather than a lost record.</b> The outbox and the inbox
/// hold delivery state; a row here says a command committed, and it is what
/// refuses the retry of an attempt whose commit landed and whose acknowledgement
/// was lost. Without it §8.5's guarantee carries the exception it carried from
/// PR-09 to this migration — at most one commit per key, <em>except</em> across
/// a lost acknowledgement.
/// <para>
/// <b>It ships to every service, including one that protects no command yet.</b>
/// That is <c>AddInbox</c>'s argument unchanged: <c>RetentionPurgeService</c>
/// runs from first boot and purges every table it was given, and a delete
/// against a table that is not there logs a failure every pass.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b><c>Key</c> is 450 characters because that is where SQL Server's clustered
/// index key stops.</b> Two bytes a character against a 900-byte limit, so this
/// is the widest the column can be while the primary key stays clustered — and
/// the key already spends 74 of those on two GUIDs and two separators, which
/// leaves the declared operation name the rest. The binary collation is the
/// inbox's argument one table over: this column is a key, the default collation
/// is case-insensitive, and two commands are the same command only if their
/// keys are the same bytes.
/// </para>
