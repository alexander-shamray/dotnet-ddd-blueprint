        // marker is the only one of the three retention tables that gets this,
        // because it is the only one whose window is a correctness setting —

        // convention derives OnAdd from a store default, measured on this
        // solution rather than read off the documentation: two properties in
        // Ordering's model configure a default and nothing else, and the
        // snapshot records ValueGeneratedOnAdd beside each. Spelling it here

        // property to a convention a later EF version could narrow.
