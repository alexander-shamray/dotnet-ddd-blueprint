// §11.4's callout is about the opposite mistake: a name an endpoint uses and
// nobody registered throws InvalidOperationException on the first request that
// reaches it, never at startup. AuthorizationPolicyTests asserts both
// directions, from the endpoint metadata rather than from this list.

// behind ICurrentUser cannot drift apart.
