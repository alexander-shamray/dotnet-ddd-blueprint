/// §13.3's messaging instruments, on the <c>Commerce.Messaging</c> meter that

/// Application because every call site is — the outbox dispatcher's invoker,
/// the two consumers beside this file, and §9.5's inbox filter one folder over.

/// <remarks>
/// <b>It arrives in instalments on <c>PluggableInterfaces.All</c>'s terms, and
/// it is not closed.</b> <c>Projected</c> landed with the outbox because
/// <c>ProjectionInvoker</c> is its only call site, the next two with the
/// consumers that record them, and <see cref="Suppressed"/> when §9.5's silent
/// drop was given a signal (#64) — an instrument nothing writes to would be an
/// empty series on a dashboard rather than a signal, which is the rule that
/// decides when one may be added rather than a statement that four is the
/// number. This doc-comment read <i>complete since PR-15</i> until the fourth
/// arrived, which is what a closure claim is worth on a class whose members
/// are added by whoever needs one.
/// <para>
/// <b>The two lags read <c>OccurredAt</c> from different places, because they
/// measure different lanes.</b> <see cref="Delivered"/> reads it off the
/// message: it covers the broker lane, every integration event carries the
/// field (§9.1), and <c>IntegrationEventConsumer&lt;T&gt;</c> reaches it through
/// the <c>IIntegrationEvent</c> constraint. <see cref="Projected"/> reads it off
/// the outbox row, which the claim returns and which <c>Stage</c> copies from
/// the message rather than from a clock — it has to, because the local lane
/// carries domain events and <c>ProjectionInvoker</c> is deliberately
/// unconstrained.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Both lags compare a timestamp made on another machine, so both are useful at
/// second granularity and meaningless below it — which is why §13.7's targets
/// for them are in seconds. <see cref="Rejected"/> carries no such caveat: it
/// is recorded at the moment the dispatcher returns a failure, on the same
/// machine.
