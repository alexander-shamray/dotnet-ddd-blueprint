/// <b>It used to be a private field on

/// consequence of the durable marker rather than tidying.</b> Both expire, and
/// the order they expire in is the whole of the constraint — so the marker's
/// own window has to be at least this long. While the claim is alive the key is
/// not claimable at all, so a purged marker costs nothing yet; the gap opens
/// when the claim expires with the marker already gone, and the retry after
/// that claims a free key and runs the command a second time. It is exactly the
/// difference between the two windows, at a boundary set by a retention number
/// — the least visible place a correctness property could be lost.
/// <c>RetentionPolicy</c> refuses a window below this value, and it reads the
/// value rather than restating it: a 24 written in two files is a number that
/// agrees until one of them is edited.
