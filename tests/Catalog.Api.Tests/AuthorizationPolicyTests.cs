/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A policy name is a reference and nothing checks it.
/// <c>RequireAuthorization("catalog:write")</c> takes a string — misspell it,
/// or register the policy in a helper the host never calls, and there is no
/// compiler error, no <c>ValidateOnBuild</c> failure and no startup warning.
/// The endpoint throws <c>InvalidOperationException</c> the first time somebody
/// publishes a product, which is to say in production, on the path that matters.
///
/// This reads the names off the built endpoints rather than from a list beside
/// the registrations, which is the whole point: a list would be a third place
/// to keep in step, and it would agree with itself while disagreeing with the
/// host. The unreachable-infrastructure factory is enough — routing and
/// authorization are built from registrations, and neither asks the database
