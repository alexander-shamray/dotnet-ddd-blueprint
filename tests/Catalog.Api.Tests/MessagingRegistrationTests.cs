/// <c>AddMassTransit</c> bus with the in-memory transport — verified against

/// COMPOSES (its eager key read runs, its options land, nothing conflicts
/// with the consumer bindings) and that MassTransit's pipeline delivers.
/// What the swap deliberately removes is the <c>UsingRabbitMq</c> transport
/// configuration itself, so that half is asserted where it can be true: in
/// <c>DatabaseSmokeTests</c>, against a real broker.
