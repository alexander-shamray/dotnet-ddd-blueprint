/// namespace <i>pattern</i> moved the hole one namespace further out; excluding
/// compiler-generated types by name exempted **endpoint lambdas**, because a
/// closure is generated code; and filtering candidates through
/// <c>HaveName(...)</c> exempted them again, because that predicate selects
/// nothing for a nested async state machine and an empty selection reports
/// success.
/// <para>
/// So this version selects <b>nothing at all</b> and filters the
/// <i>result</i>. There is no candidate set to be narrow, no predicate to miss
/// a name, and no empty selection to pass vacuously — the assembly is judged
/// whole, and the composition root is subtracted from the failures afterwards,
/// where full names are available to subtract it by.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>A residual survives all four shapes, and it is the tool's rather than
/// the rule's.</b> NetArchTest does not analyse compiler-generated nested
/// types, so a forbidden reference used <i>only</i> inside an endpoint lambda
/// is invisible to it. Measured both ways, which is the only reason this is
/// stated rather than guessed: a <c>DbContextOptionsBuilder</c> in
/// an endpoint method's own body fails this gate and names that endpoint
/// class; the identical line inside one of its lambdas leaves it green —
/// including with no selector at all, which is what rules out a narrowing
/// predicate as the cause.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So the shape below is the strongest available and not a complete one. It
