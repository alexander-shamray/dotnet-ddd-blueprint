/// §9.1's single-identity rule, checked where it is actually kept: on the

/// hop that makes the last two agree with the first two.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>Nothing else covers those two lines.</b> The dispatcher's other Broker
/// test asserts that publishing returned and the row completed, and both stay
/// green with the assignments deleted — §12.4 justified the gap by pointing at
/// §9.5's inbox tests, which dedupe on <c>context.MessageId</c> and so would
/// catch it end to end, except that they arrive with PR-15 and this ships now.
/// <para>
/// A substitute for <c>IPublishEndpoint</c> rather than a harness: §12.4
/// refuses to bolt an <c>ITestHarness</c> onto this fixture, because it runs
/// the real host against the real broker on purpose and a harness would
/// replace the bus configuration the other tests exist to exercise. Capturing
/// the pipe costs one registration in one factory, disturbs nothing else, and
