        // record's generated equality goes through EqualityComparer<T>, which
        // lives there. No collection type appears in any domain signature.
        // System.Linq earned its line with Money's currency guard —
        // enumerable logic over owned values is domain work, not an I/O
        // dependency, and §5.4's Order sample already leans on it.
