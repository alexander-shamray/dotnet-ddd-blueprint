/// <remarks>
/// <b>The distinct tokens are the point, not the absence of a provider.</b>
/// §9.7 and §11.5 both claim that the credential handler sits inside the
/// resilience pipeline, so a retried attempt goes back to the cache instead of
/// replaying the token the first attempt built. That claim is only observable
/// if two attempts can be told apart, and a constant token makes the correct
/// pipeline and the reversed one produce byte-identical requests — the shape
/// this repository keeps finding: a test that cannot fail in one direction.
/// <para>
/// <b>Answering differently every time is a test instrument and not a model of
/// production.</b> The real <c>CachingTokenClient</c> hands back the same token
/// until its expiry guard, and its own tests assert exactly that — so two
/// attempts milliseconds apart normally carry identical bytes. What this makes
/// visible is that the handler <i>ran</i> again, which is the thing the
/// ordering decides; refreshing an expired token is what that buys, and it is
/// rarer than every wording of this claim used to suggest.
