/// <summary>
/// The §4.2 gates for this layer. Green on an empty skeleton by design — "an
/// architecture rule introduced before the violations exist is a constraint",
/// and these have been observed failing against a deliberately added
/// forbidden reference.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>Two shapes, because §4.2's table has two.</b> A row that says what a
/// project <i>may</i> reference gets an allow-list gate, and a row that says a
/// project may reference any package gets a named deny. This project's row is
/// the first kind, so the gate below is an allow-list over
/// <c>GetReferencedAssemblies</c> — the same instrument the Domain gate uses
/// one project down, and for the same reason: a blacklist only bans what
/// somebody thought to name.
/// <para>
/// <b>What that instrument sees is narrower than the table's word, and the
/// gap is worth knowing before trusting a green run.</b>
/// <c>GetReferencedAssemblies</c> reads the emitted <c>AssemblyRef</c> table,
/// and the compiler writes an entry only for an assembly whose types the
/// compiled code actually names. A forbidden <c>ProjectReference</c> or
/// <c>PackageReference</c> that nothing <i>uses</i> emits nothing, so this
/// gate goes green on a project that declares one. It fires the moment any
/// code names a type across that edge, which makes the gate late rather than
/// absent — the escape needs the reference to be both forbidden and entirely
/// unused.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Closing it means reading the declared graph instead of the compiled one,
/// which is a repo-wide build change with a silent-failure mode of its own —
/// see §4.2, which states the reach and what closing it would cost. The limit
/// belongs to the Domain gate one project down as much as to this one, and
/// predates the PR that wrote this comment.

        // all excluded by not appearing, and so is another service's assembly,
        // which §4.3 forbids and which no deny-list here would have thought to
        // mention.
        //
        // Each entry earns its line, and the two that surprise a reader are
        // deliberate. Dapper is the read side of §6.5 — query handlers use it
        // directly and never EF, which Catalog.Application.csproj states at
        // the reference itself — and System.Data.Common comes with it, because
        // §6.5's IDbConnectionFactory hands back a DbConnection.
        //
        // Common.Domain is the third: §4.2's row names this service's Domain
        // and not the building block underneath it, because a service's Domain
        // cannot exist without Common.Domain (§4.2's first row) and arrives
        // carrying it. The table is about project references, where the line
        // is genuinely absent; this gate is about assembly references, where
        // the mapper's IDomainEvent puts it here whether or not a csproj says
        // so.
        //
        // The list is a subset check and not an equality: an entry for
        // something no longer referenced is a pre-authorised hole rather than
        // a failure, which is the same trade the Domain gate takes. What both
        // buy is that ADDING one is a decision somebody has to write down.
