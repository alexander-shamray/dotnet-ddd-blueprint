/// <summary>
/// The policy is service-configurable by design — §9.5 tells the reader to
/// check the inbox window against their broker's redelivery limits — so it is
/// caller-supplied, and what is caller-supplied has to be a value the type
/// refuses to hold wrongly. <c>OutboxTable</c>'s principle, applied to the
/// other registered value.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Every one of these settings fails <em>quietly</em> when it is non-positive,
/// which is why they are refused rather than clamped or logged. A negative
/// window puts the cutoff in the future and deletes the rows just written; a
/// zero batch size or ceiling turns every pass into a no-op and stops retention
/// with nothing to see. Only the interval is loud, and it is loud on a
/// background thread inside a host that has already reported ready.
