"""Render a new service from the Catalog template (Appendix C, PR-11).

    python tools/new-service/new_service.py Yankee --port 5199

There is no template directory, and that is the design rather than an
omission. The template is `src/Services/Catalog` and `tests/Catalog.*`
themselves — the copy CI builds and `dotnet test` exercises — so there is
exactly one copy of the wiring and an improvement to Catalog reaches the next
service the next time this runs. A tokenised template beside it would be a
second copy that nothing builds and nothing reconciles, which is the drift
class this repository exists to avoid.

The price is that this file names text inside files people edit. It is paid
rather than hidden: every anchor below must match exactly once, the whole
render is built in memory and validated before anything is written, and a miss
raises ScaffoldError naming the file. A tool that fails open on its own
precondition reports success for work it did not do.

Since #161 it also LOADS `.github/secret-scan/secret_scan.py` and runs it over
what it has just rendered. §15.1's gate reads the working tree, so a service
carrying a credential-shaped literal with no accepted-finding entry beside it
cannot be committed at all — and the fingerprints those entries name are the
scanner's own, never a second implementation of its matching. Where that gate
is not in the tree the step writes nothing and says nothing, which is stated
here rather than discovered from a green run.

Stdlib only, like the licence gate, and for the same reasons: no restore, no
SDK, and it runs on Windows and on the Ubuntu runner without either noticing.

**Python 3.12 is the floor**, because that is what both CI jobs pin. A newer
interpreter on a developer machine is the hazard, not an older one: it accepts
APIs the floor does not, and the local suite goes green on code CI cannot run.
`Path.read_text(newline=…)` is 3.13 and was exactly that mistake once.

# sentence the entry carries. Written in the template's own casings and put
# through `Names.rename` like every other string here, so `Catalog` below
# reaches the file as the service being rendered.
#
# A ROW IS NOT A SECOND MATCHER, and the distinction is the whole reason this
# imports the gate rather than reproducing it. The scanner decides what a
# finding is and what its fingerprint is; a marker only tells two findings of
# one rule in one file apart. The Compose file needs that much: a service's
# database default and its broker URI are both `credential-assignment` on
# adjacent lines, and they take different sentences because they record
# different decisions.
#
# A MARKER IS NEVER A TEST OF WHOSE FINDING IT IS, and it used to be read as
# one. Nothing in a row names the service being rendered, `"" in line` is true
# of every line, and the line the scanner reports for a password hash carries
# the value with the account name above it — so a render whose allow-list had
# lost a *previous* service's entry matched that service's finding, wrote a
# sentence naming the service being rendered, and cleared it. A suppression
# arriving for a credential the run is not writing is exactly what the
# allow-list's header says must never happen. `update_allowed_secrets`
# subtracts the findings the file already had, which settles ownership before
# a marker is consulted.
#
# EVERY MARKER IS NON-EMPTY, AND THAT IS ENFORCED RATHER THAN OBSERVED. Four
# of these rows carried `""` on the argument that the subtraction above made
# them safe, and that argument does not reach them: subtraction is defined
# over a path's ORIGINAL, so it protects the shared files in `updated` and
# nothing in `created`, which is where three of the four live. A rendered
# `HostSmokeTests.cs` gaining a SECOND `connection-string-password` literal
# would have been handed this row's sentence — a reason written about a
# different credential, which is the invented suppression the paragraph below
# refuses, arriving through the one path that skipped the refusal. So the
# emptiness is now a refusal of its own, because a row is a decision and `""`
# is the spelling of not having taken one.
#
# A NON-EMPTY MARKER IS STILL ONLY A NARROWING, so the run also checks what
# each row actually explained: one row that accounts for two findings with
# different fingerprints has not discriminated between them, whatever it
# matched on. That check is the subject-of-the-gate one — it reads what the
# table selected rather than trusting the table — and it is what catches a
# marker that is loose without being empty.
#
# THE COMPOSE MARKERS COME FROM THE VALUE, NOT THE KEY, and that is the second
# half of the same lesson. `ConnectionStrings__Catalog` renames to
# `ConnectionStrings__<Name>`, which is a substring of the broker line's
# `ConnectionStrings__RabbitMq` whenever the name is a prefix of `RabbitMq` —
# `R`, `Ra`, up to `RabbitMq` itself, eight legal PascalCase names that cleared
# every other precondition and then refused the run with a message blaming the
# template. A database name and a URI scheme are in the value, where no service
# name reaches them.
#
# A FINDING NO ROW EXPLAINS REFUSES THE RUN, on `classify`'s argument one
# function over. A reason this script invented would be a suppression nobody
# wrote, which is the one thing the allow-list's own header says it must never
# hold — so a new credential-shaped literal in the template is a decision this

    left exactly as the tool wrote them. The *last* template migration's
    designer resolves both: it already holds EF's description of a model with
    both messaging entities in it, which is what a scaffolded service has once
    `without_slice_entity` has taken the aggregate out, so the class wrapper is
    rewritten and the model body is never retyped.

    The last one, and taking an earlier one would be wrong in a way with no
    symptom until the service's first `migrations add`: the outbox designer
    knows nothing of the inbox, so the snapshot would omit a table the
    `DbContext` maps and EF would generate a second `CreateTable` for one the
    scaffolded migrations had already created.

    The designer reaching here has already had the aggregate removed — the
    render loop does that before its slice check, so that a failed removal
    stops the run rather than reaching a shipped file. Stripping again here
    would find nothing and `require_once` would say so.

    named the second-to-last migration, every anchor below missed at once, and

    Resolved from `repo_root` and never from this file's own location. The
    suite renders into temporary roots holding the template and the shared
    files and no `.github/` at all, so a gate resolved from `__file__` would
    read the real repository's rules and the real allow-list while writing
    into a tree that has neither — green, and about nothing.

    **`.github/` missing is the degradation; the gate missing is a refusal**,
    and the two used to be one test. A checkout with the directory and without
    one of its two files is a real tree, and returning None there rendered a
    service the scanner refuses without saying so — #161 back, quietly, from
    the code that closed it. It is also the only shared file whose absence was
    tolerated: the other six raise inside `read`.

    Loaded by path rather than by `import`, and the difference is not a
    formality: `import` caches by module name, so a second render against a
    second root would silently reuse the first root's gate, and the suite
    renders against several roots in one process. There is no `sys.path`
    manipulation anywhere in this repository and this does not add the first.
    `spec_from_file_location` is the form already in use here —
    `deploy/compose/rabbitmq/test_check_permissions.py` loads its subject that
    way, and so does `.claude/scripts/test_grok_helpers.py`; what is new is
    only the directory being crossed.

    **This executes a file chosen by `--repo-root`, and it is checked against
    the copy this script shipped with before it runs.** An earlier revision
    said the exposure "is not new" because the tool already reads the target's
    source and writes into its tree, and that was wrong in the way that
    matters: copying text is not running it, and a tool that renders a service
    into a checkout does not thereby earn the right to execute that checkout's
    Python with the developer's privileges.

    **Loading it from `TOOL_ROOT` instead was the obvious repair and it breaks
    a correctness invariant.** The entries written here carry the SCANNER'S
    fingerprints, and the scanner that will later verify them is the one in the
    tree being rendered into, because that is the checkout CI runs from. Two
    different implementations agreeing today is not the property needed; the
    entries have to be computed by the same code that checks them, or a
    fingerprint matching nothing becomes a stale entry and the build stops on
    it.

    So the two are reconciled by requiring them to be the SAME FILE rather than
    choosing between them: the target's gate is executed, and only after its
    bytes are established to be the ones here. Identical bytes make the
    invariant and the trust boundary the same statement. A target whose scanner
    differs is refused rather than run, which is also the honest answer for
    rendering at all — the template anchors this script matches are that
    repository's too.

    `secret_scan.py` is stdlib-only and guards its own entry point, so loading
    the file this repository ships runs no scan and touches nothing.
